Blue eyes. Lactose tolerance. What do all of these traits have in common? Every one of them has emerged in the last 10,000 years.</B><BR><BR>Scientists have long believed that the ¬ìgreat leap forward‚Äù that occurred some 40,000 to 50,000 years ago in Europe marked end of significant biological evolution in humans. In this stunningly original account of our evolutionary history, top scholars Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending reject this conventional wisdom and reveal that the human species has undergone a storm of genetic change much more recently. Human evolution in fact accelerated after civilization arose, they contend, and these ongoing changes have played a pivotal role in human history. They argue that biology explains the expansion of the Indo-Europeans, the European conquest of the Americas, and European Jews' rise to intellectual prominence. In each of these cases, the key was recent genetic change: adult milk tolerance in the early Indo-Europeans that allowed for a new way of life, increased disease resistance among the Europeans settling America, and new versions of neurological genes among European Jews.<BR><BR>Ranging across subjects as diverse as human domestication, Neanderthal hybridization, and IQ tests, Cochran and Harpending's analysis demonstrates convincingly that human genetics have changed and can continue to change much more rapidly than scientists have previously believed. A provocative and fascinating new look at human evolution that turns conventional wisdom on its head, <I>The 10,000 Year Explosion</I> reveals the ongoing interplay between culture and biology in the making of the human race.</div> - from Amzon","Civilization & Culture, Biological Sciences, Genetics",""

With the same passion he brought to the challenge of climate change, and with his decades of experience on the front lines of global policy, Al Gore surveys our planet‚Äôs beclouded horizon and offers a sober, learned, and ultimately hopeful forecast in the visionary tradition of Alvin Toffler‚Äôs <i>Future Shock</i> and John Naisbitt‚Äôs <i>Megatrends</i>. In <i>The Future,</i> Gore identifies the emerging forces that are reshaping our world:<br> ¬†<br> ‚Ä¢ Ever-increasing economic globalization has led to the emergence of what he labels ‚ÄúEarth Inc.‚Äù‚Äîan integrated holistic entity with a new and different relationship to capital, labor, consumer markets, and national governments than in the past.<br> ‚Ä¢ The worldwide digital communications, Internet, and computer revolutions have led to the emergence of ‚Äúthe Global Mind,‚Äù which links the thoughts and feelings of billions of people and connects intelligent machines, robots, ubiquitous sensors, and databases.<br> ‚Ä¢ The balance of global political, economic, and military power is shifting more profoundly than at any time in the last five hundred years‚Äîfrom a U.S.-centered system to one with multiple emerging centers of power, from nation-states to private actors, and from political systems to markets.<br> ‚Ä¢ A deeply flawed economic compass is leading us to unsustainable growth in consumption, pollution flows, and depletion of the planet‚Äôs strategic resources of topsoil, freshwater, and living species.<br> ‚Ä¢ Genomic, biotechnology, neuroscience, and life sciences revolutions are radically transforming the fields of medicine, agriculture, and molecular science‚Äîand are putting control of evolution in human hands.<br> ‚Ä¢ There has been a radical disruption of the relationship between human beings and the earth‚Äôs ecosystems, along with the beginning of a revolutionary transformation of energy systems, agriculture, transportation, and construction worldwide.<br> ¬†<br> From his earliest days in public life, Al Gore has been warning us of the promise and peril of emergent truths‚Äîno matter how ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù they may seem to be.
