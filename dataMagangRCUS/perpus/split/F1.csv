"27","A Certain Age: Colonial Jakarta through the Memories of Its Intellectuals","Rudolf Mrázek","","","","Duke University Press Books","",2010,NA,"0822346974",9780822346975,"","F1","Unknown",NA,"Book","<div><I>A Certain Age</I> is an unconventional, evocative work of history and a moving reflection on memory, modernity, space, time, and the limitations of traditional historical narratives. Rudolf Mrázek visited Indonesia throughout the 1990s, recording lengthy interviews with elderly intellectuals in and around Jakarta. With few exceptions, they were part of an urban elite born under colonial rule and educated at Dutch schools. From the early twentieth century, through the late colonial era, the national revolution, and well into independence after 1945, these intellectuals injected their ideas of modernity, progress, and freedom into local and national discussion.</p><P>When Mrázek began his interviews, he expected to discuss phenomena such as the transition from colonialism to postcolonialism. His interviewees, however, wanted to share more personal recollections. Mrázek illuminates their stories of the past with evocative depictions of their late-twentieth-century surroundings. He brings to bear insights from thinkers including Walter Benjamin, Bertold Brecht, Le Corbusier, and Marcel Proust, and from his youth in Prague, another metropolis with its own experience of passages and revolution. Architectural and spatial tropes organize the book. Thresholds, windowsills, and sidewalks come to seem more apt as descriptors of historical transitions than colonial and postcolonial, or modern and postmodern. Asphalt roads, homes, classrooms, fences, and windows organize movement, perceptions, and selves in relation to others. <I>A Certain Age</I> is a portal into questions about how the past informs the present and how historical accounts are inevitably partial and incomplete.</div> - from Amzon","Southeast Asia, Cultural, Asia, Anthropology",""

The book is as much about the making and reshaping of civic places as it is about urban architecture per se. According to Rowe, the best civic place-making occurs across the divide between the state and civil society. By contrast, the alternatives are not very attractive. On the one side are state-sponsored edifices and places of authoritarian nature. On the other are the exclusive enclaves of corporate-dominated urban and suburban environments.</p> - from Amzon","Buildings, Urban & Land Use Planning, Architecture, Architecture",""

In considering technology and the ways that people use and think about <i>things</i>, Rudolf Mrázek invents an original way to talk about freedom, colonialism, nationalism, literature, revolution, and human nature.</p><br> <p>The central chapters comprise vignettes and take up, in turn, transportation (from shoes to road-building to motorcycle clubs), architecture (from prison construction to home air-conditioning), optical technologies (from photography to fingerprinting), clothing and fashion, and the introduction of radio and radio stations. The text clusters around a group of fascinating recurring characters representing colonialism, nationalism, and the awkward, inevitable presence of the European cultural, intellectual, and political avant-garde: Tillema, the pharmacist-author of Kromoblanda; the explorer/engineer IJzerman; the ""Javanese princess"" Kartina; the Indonesia nationalist journalist Mas Marco; the Dutch novelist Couperus; the Indonesian novelist Pramoedya Ananta Toer; and Dutch left-wing liberal Wim Wertheim and his wife.</p><br> <p>In colonial Indies, as elsewhere, people employed what Proust called ""remembering"" and what Heidegger called ""thinging"" to sense and make sense of the world. In using this observation to approach Indonesian society, Mrázek captures that society off balance, allowing us to see it in unfamiliar positions. The result is a singular work with surprises for readers throughout the social sciences, not least those interested in Southeast Asia or colonialism more broadly.</p> - from Amzon","Southeast Asia, Engineering, General, Nationalism",""

Invariably depicted as the country's ""dynamic economic powerhouse,"" it is rarely considered as a cultural centre in its own right, a shortcoming no doubt reinforced by the frightening rate at which the city's remaining old buildings continue to be demolished and replaced by gleaming new tower blocks. 
<p> Yet there is another side to the southern capital. If you look hard enough you can still find what's left of the elegant architectural heritage which once won the city the title ""Pearl of the Orient."" This book seeks to identify that heritage and enable visitors to experience it through a series of walking tours. </p> 
<p> Since there is a great del to see and do in Ho Chi Minh City, all of the walking tours in the book are relatively lengthy. Furthermore, many of the tours take you to a selection of museums, temples, pagodas, communal houses and other intriguing destinations which may each demand a visit of 30 minutes or more.Thus, unless you have a half day or even a whole day to devote to each walking tour, you might first wish to use each one as a means of finding your bearings and getting to know the main sights of the city, perhaps just visiting one or two attractions as you walk and saving the remainder for subsequent visits.</p> - from Amzon","",""

He begins with his childhood among the eccentric extended Pamuk family in the dusty, carpeted, and hermetically sealed apartment building they shared. In this place came his first intimations of the melancholy awareness that binds all residents of his city together: that of living in the seat of ruined imperial glories, in a country trying to become “modern” at the dizzying crossroads of East and West. This elegiac communal spirit overhangs Pamuk’s reflections as he introduces the writers and painters (among the latter, most particularly the German Antoine-Ignace Melling) through whose eyes he came to see Istanbul. Against a background of shattered monuments, neglected villas,  ghostly backstreets, and, above all, the fabled waters of the Bosphorus, he presents the interplay of his budding sense of place with that of his predecessors. And he charts the evolution of a rich, sometimes macabre, imaginative life, which furnished a daydreaming boy refuge from family discord and inner turmoil, and which would continue to serve the famous writer he was to become. It was, and remains, a life fed by the changing microcosm of the apartment building and, even more, the beckoning kaleidoscope beyond its walls. <br><br>As much a portrait of the artist as a young man as it is an oneiric Joycean map of the city, <i>Istanbul</i> is a masterful evocation of its subject through the idiosyncrasies of direct experience as much as the power of myth--the dazzling book Pamuk was born to write. - from Amzon","Authors, Memoirs, Travel, Istanbul, General, Travel Writing",""

It traces the evolution of urban and metropolitan governance in India and examines the key aspects related to urban dynamics such as urban and regional planning, economic competitiveness, infrastructure and land management, environmental sustainability as well as the challenges in resource mobilization and metropolitan governance. The study is based on an extensive compilation of data on aspects such as demographics, economy, infrastructure, society, environment, political character, and institutions for governance. It provides an introduction to megacities in the Indian context and explains how urbanization was never promoted in the Indian Planning regime. While contributing greatly to the economic growth of the respective states and the country, the physical and demographic growth of these megacities has been accompanied by an ever increasing demand for infrastructure and essential services as well as social and environmental pressures. The governance and management of megacities has thus emerged as a formidable challenge to policymakers, administrators, and urban professionals.
