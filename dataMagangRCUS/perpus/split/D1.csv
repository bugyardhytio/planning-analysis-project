Recognizing that green buildings alone do not make a green city, <I>Green Dream </I>also looks at broader green solutions for cities and how they might be implemented. Most importantly of all, the book dares to ask ""Is a green city actually feasible?"" and attempts to answer this question through the help of case studies. Drawing on 36 illustrated green projects, and with essays by John Thackara and Winy Maas, this volume outlines future goals for architectural and urban projects, and draws on research by The Why Factory, MVRDV and Delft University of Technology. - from Amzon","Urban & Land Use Planning, Sustainability & Green Design",""

The result is a view of a world that no longer seems real but appears instead as a series of dream-images from an eccentric director or computer game designer. References to reality evoke a sense of conflict in the viewer, as appreciation for the beauty of the absurd competes with recognition of an irreversible process of change in urban living space. Two different growth models are exposed: unscrupulous, uncontrolled expansion, as in Bangkok, and controlled, yet equally unscrupulous growth in a city like Shanghai. The pictures burst with conflicting signs and symbols, mostly indecipherable to the western viewer, a semiotic overkill held in check only by the edge of the picture frame. - from Amzon","Individual Artists, Color, Individual Photographers, Foreign Language Study & Reference",""

Yet traditional forms of sharing have been undermined in modern cities by social fragmentation and commercialization of the public realm. In <i> Sharing Cities</i>, Duncan McLaren and Julian Agyeman argue that the intersection of cities' highly networked physical space with new digital technologies and new mediated forms of sharing offers cities the opportunity to connect smart technology to justice, solidarity, and sustainability. McLaren and Agyeman explore the opportunities and risks for sustainability, solidarity, and justice in the changing nature of sharing. </p><p>McLaren and Agyeman propose a new ""sharing paradigm,"" which goes beyond the faddish ""sharing economy"" -- seen in such ventures as Uber and TaskRabbit -- to envision models of sharing that are not always commercial but also communal, encouraging trust and collaboration. Detailed case studies of San Francisco, Seoul, Copenhagen, Medellín, Amsterdam, and Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) contextualize the authors' discussions of collaborative consumption and production; the shared public realm, both physical and virtual; the design of sharing to enhance equity and justice; and the prospects for scaling up the sharing paradigm though city governance. They show how sharing could shift values and norms, enable civic engagement and political activism, and rebuild a shared urban commons. Their case for sharing and solidarity offers a powerful alternative for urban futures to conventional ""race-to-the-bottom"" narratives of competition, enclosure, and division. </p> - from Amzon","Environmental Economics, Sustainable Development, Environmental, Environmental Science, Urban Planning & Development, Urban, City Planning & Urban Development",""

His narratives -- reprinted from the New Yorker -- begin with the contradictions of Singapore, prosperous and tidy, whose competent, incorruptible leaders rule by fear. In desperately poor Laos, where the United States dropped more bombs than on Nazi Germany, villagers fashion daily essentials from remnant munitions and the wreckage of drowned planes. A chilling report on Cambodia warns of the political re-emergence of the murderous Khmer Rouge. A portrait of Burma limns how that republic's form of Buddhism tolerates tyranny and describes the nascent protest movement led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Sesser does not condemn all logging in Borneo, but finds the telling detail: in Japan, the logs become plywood, as ""the gold of Sarawak rain forest [is] minted into pennies""' Publishers Weekly 'Stan Sesser's beautifully observed book about the successes, the turmoils, and the disasters of Southeast Asia is a marvellous testament to his skills as a reporter and to fine writing. It is an invaluable piece of work' William Shawcross - from Amzon","Travel, General",""

Now in its eighth year, ANCB decided to broaden its experimental journey as an independent public platform with an annual magazine entitled The Metropolitan Laboratory that further explores our deliberate goal of providing an alternative urban discourse. Entitled “Education: Trial and Error”, this first issue looks at the topic of artistic and architectural education. As a survey of highly progressive pedagogical approaches, it questions the role of education in past, present, and future. The broad spectrum of articles and essays ranges from Black Mountain College, Joseph Beuys, Paul Thek, Cedric Price, and Oswald Ungers all the way to Beatriz Colomina, Olafur Eliasson, Ai Wei Wei, Thom Mayne, Odile Decq, Peter Cook, and Joan Ockmann, to mention but a few. Inherent to all of these contributions is a profound apprehension of the positive surplus of unsolicited changes, uninvited irritants, unanticipated setbacks, and failures as the future seeds of human achievement and progress. - from Amzon","Individual Architects & Firms, Design History & Criticism",""
