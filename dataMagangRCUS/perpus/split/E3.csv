Singapore, as a tiny island city-state, does not have a rural hinterland or natural resources. Yet the environment has been considered no less important and has presented the challenge of its reconciliation with urban management. Since 1968, when the concept of a 'clean and green garden city' was first introduced, Singapore's political leadership has taken an active role in managing the environmental impact of urban growth and industrialization, achieving a balance between conservation and development. The aim, in the words of then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, is to become ""a city worthy of an industrious people whose quest for progress is matched by their appreciation for the beauty of nature."" This book is an account of Singapore's programmes and policies on environmental management. - from Amzon","Economics, Asia, Environmental, Environmental Science, Asian, Asia, Environmental Studies, Political Science",""
