For the Western leader assigned to the Chinese mainland, the career opportunities are unsurpassed. Expatriates have the privilege of playing a pivotal role in one of the most exciting economic and cultural transformations in recent world history. The time spent leading and managing in China will prove to be one of the most challenging, dynamic, and personally rewarding assignments an expatriate could hope to imagine. Leadership Success in China: An Expatriate s Guide is written for expatriate leaders who want to jump-start their China career and quickly get up and running in their new environment. The complexities of managing a team steeped in a culture vastly different from the expatriate s own cannot be underestimated. Some tried-and-true Western business practices can be applied; others will fall flat in the face of China s cultural differences. Still other, unique practices heretofore unknown to the expatriate leader might be a better fit. Leadership Success in China: An Expatriate s Guide details what techniques and practices will work for expatriates in China and how others, such as performance management and selection, will need to be augmented for the Chinese culture. It also notes the traps and pitfalls for the expatriate to avoid. This book is a practical, must-have handbook for leaders charged with building a productive, trusting, empowered team in China that can achieve the business and strategic goals set forth by the head office. Who Should Read It Leadership Success in China: An Expatriate s Guide is written for executives, managers, and human resource professionals who are on assignment or soon will be in mainland China and those who will interact frequently with Chinese as part of their managerial role. - from Amzon","",""

Philip Kotler, Donald Haider, and Irving Rein argue that thousands of ""places"" -- cities, states, and nations -- are in crisis, and can no longer rely on national industrial policies, such as federal matching funds, as a promise of jobs and protection. When trouble strikes, places resort to various palliatives such as chasing grants from state or federal sources, bidding for smokestack industries, or building convention centers and exotic attractions. The authors show instead that places must, like any market-driven business, become attractive ""products"" by improving their industrial base and communicating their special qualities more effectively to their target markets. <P> From studies of cities and nations throughout the world, Kotler, Haider, and Rein offer a systematic analysis of why so many places have fallen on hard times, and make recommendations on what can be done to revitalize a place's economy. They show how ""place wars"" -- battles for Japanese factories, government projects, Olympic Games, baseball team franchises, convention business, and other economic prizes -- are often misguided and end in wasted money and effort. The hidden key to vigorous economic development, the authors argue, is strategic marketing of places by rebuilding infrastructure, creating a skilled labor force, stimulating local business entrepreneurship and expansion, developing strong public/private partnerships, identifying and attracting ""place compatible"" companies and industries, creating distinctive local attractions, building a service-friendly culture, and promoting these advantages effectively. <P> Strategic marketing of places requires a deep understanding of how ""place buyers"" -- tourists, new residents, factories, corporate headquarters, investors -- make their place decisions. With this understanding, ""place sellers"" -- economic development agencies, tourist promotion agencies, mayor's offices -- can take the necessary steps to compete aggressively for place buyers. This straightforward guide for effectively marketing places will be the framework for economic development in the 1990s and beyond. - from Amzon","Development & Growth, Hospitality, Travel & Tourism, Global, Industrial, Research",""

Realizing the Promise of Performance Management paints the picture of an invaluable system that can underpin and permeate all organizational efforts—driving straight through to an improved bottom line. This book describes a system that can enable an organization to seamlessly execute its business and cultural strategies in full alignment with its other important HR systems, such as selection, promotion, succession planning, and compensation.   Realizing the Promise of Performance Management presents more than a dozen case studies—depicting how some of the best-known global companies have leveraged their performance management systems to retain top talent, invigorate their workforces, reduce turnover, align capabilities, and grow their business. Drawing on lessons learned from more than 30 years’ experience with hundreds of companies, Robert W. Rogers presents a strong case for the whys of performance management—why spend time doing it right, why insist that senior executives model the process, why track how well the system works, and most of all, why demand that managers become skilled users of the system. Ultimately, as you’ll see by reading this book, because it will get results. - from Amzon","",""

However, search engines such as Google or Bing determine what part of the web we get to see, shaping our knowledge and perceptions of the world. But there is a world beyond Google - geographically, culturally, and technologically.   The Society of the Query network was founded in 2009 to delve into the larger societal and cultural consequences that are triggered by search technology.
