The distinctively Chinese organization of raw-material production, the importation of labourers, and the gradual formation of a Chinese community are central themes, but also of concern is the impact of these developments on the local population. Technological change and government policies, both colonial and Indonesian, add to the picture. On the one hand, the book is a contribution to Indonesian local history; on the other, it presents much material for comparison with Chinese settlements elsewhere in Southeast Asia. - from Amzon","China, Ethnic Studies",""

More recently, there's been a large shift in perception, an awakening of social consciousness, and a realization that a strategy good for the world can also be good for your bottom line. Green Business Strategy is no longer an option; the future depends on it. This collection of HBR articles gets to the heart of why you should and must put a socially-responsible strategy at the top of your CEO's agenda. - from Amzon","Environmental Economics, Sustainable Development, Green Business, Business Development",""
