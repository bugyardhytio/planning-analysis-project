The book posits that the degree of <i>liveability</i> depends on five themes: satisfaction with the freedom from want; satisfaction with the state of the natural environment and its management; satisfaction with freedom from fear; satisfaction with the socio-cultural conditions; and satisfaction with public governance. <p> The authors attempt to be more constructive through performing policy simulations by first identifying relative weaknesses and strengths of 64 global cities across major continents including European, Asian, Middle Eastern, North and South American cities. The book also ranks and simulates 36 Asian cities separately, of which many are emerging third-world cities that are in need of policy guidance. <p> - from Amzon","Urban & Regional, Bibliographies & Indexes, Urban Planning & Development, Urban, City Planning & Urban Development",""

The essays were commissioned to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the East End voluntary organization, Community Links, but the debate they generate reaches beyond the boroughs of London. This book is a manifesto for the millennium: it is not a complaint about how bad things are, but a vision of how good things could be. Contributors include Gordon Brown, Will Hutton, Andrew O'Hagan, Bob Holman, William Boyd, Jane Tewson, Danny Silverstone, Steve Hilton, David Robinson, Stephen Jacobs, Louise France, David Grayson, Matthew Smerdon, and Will Hobson, with cartoons by Steve Bell. - from Amzon","Social Sciences, Urban",""
