The horrors of the tenement were perfected in New York at the same time that the very rich were building palaces along Fifth Avenue; public housing for the poor originated in New York, as did government subsidies for middle-class housing.<br><br>A standard in the field since its publication in 1992, <i>A History of Housing in New York City</i> traces New York's housing development from 1850 to the present in text and profuse illustrations. Richard Plunz explores the housing of all classes, with comparative discussion of the development of types ranging from the single-family house to the high-rise apartment tower. His analysis is placed within the context of the broader political and cultural development of New York City. This revised edition extends the scope of the book into the city's recent history, adding three decades to the study, covering the recent housing bubble crisis, the rebound and gentrification of the five boroughs, and the ecological issues facing the next generation of New Yorkers. More than 300 illustrations are integrated throughout the text, depicting housing plans, neighborhood changes, and city architecture over the past 130 years. This new edition also features a foreword by the distinguished urban historian Kenneth T. Jackson. - from Amzon","History, Regional, Urban & Land Use Planning, State & Local, Urban Planning & Development, City Planning & Urban Development, United States, Architecture, Public Policy",""

The author relies on interdisciplinary studies, drawing from biology, ecology, and political science, as well as from history for his fascinating study.

The automobile, the effects of the Modern Movement in architectural design, urban-renewal and zoning policies, the dominance of private over public interests, as well as changes in land use in the inner city have resulted in the loss of values and meanings that were traditionally associated with urban open space. This text offers a comprehensive and systematic examination of the crisis of the contemporary city and the means by which this crisis can be addressed. Finding Lost Space traces leading urban spatial design theories that have emerged over the past eighty years: the principles of Sitte and Howard; the impact of and reactions to the Functionalist movement; and designs developed by Team 10, Robert Venturi, the Krier brothers, and Fumihiko Maki, to name a few. In addition to discussions of historic precedents, contemporary approaches to urban spatial design are explored. Detailed case studies of Boston, Massachusetts; Washington, D.C.; Goteborg, Sweden; and the Byker area of Newcastle, England demonstrate the need for an integrated design approach--one that considers figure-ground, linkage, and place theories of urban spatial design. These theories and their individual strengths and weaknesses are defined and applied in the case studies, demonstrating how well they operate in different contexts. This text will prove invaluable for students and professionals in the fields of architecture, landscape architecture, and city planning. Finding Lost Space is going to be a primary text for the urban designers of the next generation. It is the first book in the field to absorb the lessons of the postmodern reaction, including the work of the Krier brothers and many others, and to integrate these into a coherent theory and set of design guidelines. Without polemics, Roger Trancik addresses the biggest issue in architecture and urbanism today: how can we regain in our shattered cities a public realm that is made of firmly shaped, coherently linked, humanly meaningful urban spaces?

Cross","","","","Stanford University Press","1",1998,NA,"0804730628",9780804730624,"","E1","Unknown",NA,"Book","As economic crises struck the Third World in the 1970s and 1980s, large segments of the population turned to the informal economy to survive. Though this phenomenon has previously been analyzed from a strictly economic point of view, this book looks at street vending in the largest city in the world, Mexico City, as a political process. Employing a street-level analysis based on intensive participant observation, with interviews, archival research, and surveys, the author presents a view of political processes that provides new theoretical insights into social movements, state institutions, and politics at the fringe of society, where legality blurs into illegality and the informal economy intersects with its political counterpoint―informal politics. By studying political processes at the street level and then tracing them up the political structure, the author also reveals the basic processes by which the Mexican state operates. Street vendors have been successful in defending their interests in Mexico City, the author argues, because they are able to take advantage of certain structural features of the Mexican state, notably the weak integration of interests between policy-makers and policy-implementers. The author shows that when well-organized, street vendors can collude with state policy-implementers even when state policy-makers are influenced by powerful interest groups, such as large national and multinational corporations. The book develops a systematic theory of the “political economy of economic informality” while raising new questions and theories about the state and social movements. Though the direct research is confined to the Mexican case study, the author suggests ways in which his conclusions can be applied to other developing areas in the Third World. - from Amzon","Economic Conditions, Education & Reference, Government & Business, Urban, Political Science, Political Economy, Business & Finance, Political Science, Sociology",""

For the majority of city dwellers, however, urbanization means living in the favelas of Brazil, the kampungs in Indonesia, katchi abadis in Pakistan, and in dense squatter areas of Metro Manila. For millions, life is devoid of basic human services. Inventoried and zoned according to access (or lack thereof) to basic services, quality of life in the Iskwater settlement is defined in terms of degrees of deprivation household size potable water, power supply, length of paved roads and sewage infrastructure.
<P>
This book, Lungsod Iskwater, began as an analytical exercise. Its principal focus was the most sustainable urban form in history -- the informal settlement. Despite its enduring presence over time and across cultures, the urban and architectural elements of Iskwater settlement are among the least studied, let alone the least understood. Thus, this effort attempts to provide an in-depth analysis of the relationship between built form and open space within selected informal settlements in Metropolitan Manila, and correlates specific cultural, socio-economic, political, and environmental factors. We build on the premise that informal settlements are organic combinations of interrelated and interdependent factors which may be decoded only when understood within certain cultural and historical contexts. - from Amzon","",""

The location has revealed different facets to settlers and passers-through. The city, the site of bloody battles between the British and Tipu Sultan, was once attached to the glittering court of Mysore. Later, it became a cantonment town where British troops were stationed. Over time, it morphed into a city of gardens and lakes, and the capital of Indian scientific research. More recently, it has been the hub of India s information technology boom, giving rise to Brand Bangalore, an Indian city whose name is recognized globally. Hidden beneath these layers lies a cosmopolitan city of sub-cultures, engaging artists and writers, young geeks and students. People from every corner of India and beyond now call it home.  In this collection of writings about a multi-layered city, there are stories from its history, translations from Kannada literature, personal responses to the city s mindscape, portraits of special citizens, accounts of searches for lost communities and traditions, among much more. U.R. Ananthamurthy writes about Bangalore s Kannada identity; Shashi Deshpande maps the city through the places she has lived in since she was a young girl; Anita Nair draws a touching portrait of a florist who celebrates the glories of the Raj; Ramachandra Guha describes his close bond with Bangalore s most unusual bookseller; and Rajmohan Gandhi recounts the Mahatma s trysts with the city. From traditional folk ballads to a nursery rhyme about Bangalore, from poems to blogs, from reproductions of turn of the twentieth century picture postcards to cartoons, Multiple City is the portrait of a metropolis trying to retain its roots as it hurtles into the future. - from Amzon","World, Religion & Spirituality, Philosophy",""
