The first part of the volume focuses on the role of elections, distinguishing different ways in which they may cause representation. The second part is devoted to the role of checks and balances, between the government and the parliament as well as between the government and the bureaucracy. Overall, the essays combine theoretical discussions, game-theoretic models, case studies, and statistical analyses, within a shared analytical approach and a standardized terminology. The empirical material is drawn from the well established democracies as well as from new democracies. - from Amzon","Democracy, History & Theory, Political History, Political Ideologies",""

They are, writes David Bornstein, the driven, creative individuals who question the status quo, exploit new opportunities, refuse to give up--and remake the world for the better. <br> <em>How to Change the World</em> tells the fascinating stories of these remarkable individuals--many in the United States, others in countries from Brazil to Hungary--providing an <em>In Search of Excellence</em> for the nonprofit sector. In America, one man, J.B. Schramm, has helped thousands of low-income high school students get into college. In South Africa, one woman, Veronica Khosa, developed a home-based care model for AIDS patients that changed government health policy. In Brazil, Fabio Rosa helped bring electricity to hundreds of thousands of remote rural residents. Another American, James Grant, is credited with saving 25 million lives by leading and 'marketing' a global campaign for immunization. Yet another, Bill Drayton, created a pioneering foundation, Ashoka, that has funded and supported these social entrepreneurs and over a thousand like them, leveraging the power of their ideas across the globe. <br> These extraordinary stories highlight a massive transformation that is going largely unreported by the media: Around the world, the fastest-growing segment of society is the nonprofit sector, as millions of ordinary people--social entrepreneurs--are increasingly stepping in to solve the problems where governments and bureaucracies have failed. <em>How to Change the World</em> shows, as its title suggests, that with determination and innovation, even a single person can make a surprising difference. For anyone seeking to make a positive mark on the world, this will be both an inspiring read and an invaluable handbook. - from Amzon","Volunteer Work, Entrepreneurship, Philanthropy & Charity, Politics & Government, Economics, Entrepreneurship, Political Science",""

It demonstrates that the period 1970 to 1980 will be particularly crucial for Indonesia and will require careful social and economic planning. The author, who is acknowledged to be Indonesia's foremost economist demographer,amasses and corrects population estimates made during the era of Dutch rule, including material from as early as 1775. He discusses the census of 1930 and the impact of events of the 1940's - World War II, the Japanese occupation, and the Indonesian revolution - on population trends. He points out, for example, that low birth and high mortality rates during the subsequent period, suggest that the mean age of Indonesia's working age population is undergoing a radical rejuvenation.  Using the census of 1961 as a base, Mr. Widjojo projects Indonesia's population to 1991, forecasting the probable growth rates of the total population and of its various components. He shows how the population breaks down into extremely uneven age groups and suggests the serious consequences of this situation. He emphasizes that the dramatic increases in the number of 15-to-24-year-olds that occurred in the population during the second half of the 1960's and that are projected for the 1970's make careful preparation for the future imperative if crises in the labor market and in the field of education are to be dealt with successfully.  Population Trends in Indonesia, now brought back to life as a member of Equinox Publishing's Classic Indonesia series, serves as a model for future research and proves invaluable to economic and social planners working throughout the developing world.  Widjojo Nitisastro, former Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Indonesia, was Chairman of President Suharto's Economic Team and of the National Development Planning Agency. A graduate of the University of Indonesia, Professor Widjojo received a Ph.D. degree in Economics from the University of California at Berkeley. - from Amzon","Demography, Sociology, Sociology",""

Ten years ago, Michael Pollan confronted us with this seemingly simple question and, with <i>The Omnivore’s Dilemma, </i>his brilliant and eye-opening exploration of our food choices, demonstrated that how we answer it today may determine not only our health but our survival as a species. In the years since, Pollan’s revolutionary examination has changed the way Americans think about food. Bringing wide attention to the little-known but vitally important dimensions of food and agriculture in America, Pollan launched a national conversation about what we eat and the profound consequences that even the simplest everyday food choices have on both ourselves and the natural world. Ten years later, <i>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</i> continues to transform the way Americans think about the politics, perils, and pleasures of eating. - from Amzon","History, Paleo, Vegan, Nutrition, Reference, Popular Culture",""

This new and important book shows how technological advances are driving forms of `collaborative consumption' which will change forever the ways in which we interact both with businesses and with each other.The average lawn mower is used for four hours a year. The average power drill is used for only twenty minutes in its entire lifespan. The average car is unused for 22 hours a day, and even when it is being used there are normally three empty seats. Surely there must be a way to get the benefit out of things like mowers, drills and even cars, without having to carry the huge up-front costs of ownership?There is indeed. Collaborative consumption is not just a buzzword, it is a new win-win way of life. This insightful and thought-provoking new book by Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers is an important and fast-moving survey of the dramatic changes we are seeing in the way we consume products.Many of us are familiar with freecycle, eBay, couchsurfing and Zipcar. But these are just the beginning of a new phenomenon. Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers have interviewed business leaders and opinion formers around the world to draw together the many strands of Collaborative Consumption into a coherent and challenging argument to show that the way we did business and consumerism in the 20th century is not the way we will do it in the 21st century. - from Amzon","Macroeconomics, Consumer Behavior, Social Sciences",""
