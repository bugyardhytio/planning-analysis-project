Di latar-belakang masih tersembunyi sekitar tiga-ribuan buku lain milik pribadi sang pencerita yang memancarkan pengaruhnya, kendati tidak bisa dapat tempat lagi untuk diceritakan. Sang pencerita hendak memindahkan sebagian buku itu ke museum khusus di daerah tempat lahirnya, Yogyakarta, dan sebagian lagi di rumahnya, dengan harapan akan dimanfaatkan oleh umum. Lewat karyanya ini ia terlebih dulu ingin bercerita kepada cucu-cucunya, dan dengan itu kepada generasi mereka. - from Amzon","",""
