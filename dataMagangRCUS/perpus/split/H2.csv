How should we, the descendants of the Allies who won the victory in that war, reply to the moral challenge of the descendants of those whose cities were targeted? A.C. Grayling looks at the stands people took, both for and against, and crucially asks what the lessons are that we can learn for today about how people should behave in a world of tension and moral confusion, of terrorism and fragile democracies. ""Among the Dead Cities"" is both a lucid and revealing work of modern history and an investigation of conscience into one of the last remaining controversies of that time. - from Amzon","",""

However, such an approach can neglect the powerful influences exerted upon the state by social and economic forces. This important and controversial new book examines the way in which one of these forces, capital, has emerged in the past two decades as a major influence upon the state, its officials and policies.  The emergence of the capitalist class is examined, along with its internal divisions and conflicts and its relations with the state. In particular, attention is given to the fusion of the ruling strata of state officials and the capitalist class – the potential basis for a new ruling class. This is set against the weakness of capital caused by its division into domestic and international, state and private, Chinese and indigenous. These factors are in turn set in the context of international influences – the rise and fall of the oil boom, the activities of the IBRD and IMF, the decline of export earnings and the fiscal difficulties of the state. Since its original publication in 1986, Indonesia: The Rise of Capital has been the best selling academic book on Indonesian politics and the most cited in the SSCI and Google Scholar citation indexes. <p> About the Author<p> At the time of this publication in 1986, Richard Robison was Senior Lecturer in the Asian Studies Program at Murdoch University. He is now Emeritus Professor at Murdoch University and has been Professor of Political Economy at the International Institute of Social Studies in The Hague (2003–2006) and Professor and Director of the Australian Research Council’s Special Centre for Research on Political and Social Change in Contemporary Asia (1995–1999). He is the author, editor of 14 books and has published in major international journals, including World Politics, World Development, Pacific Review, New Political Economy and the Journal of Development Studies. Professor Robison has been awarded Senior research fellowships from the Fulbright Foundation and the Leverhulme Trust. - from Amzon","Economic History, Economics",""

The mixture of historians and practitioners is critical because statements about the environment inevitably measure present and future conditions against those of the past.

Great intelligence and good luck are not required.”</i></p> <p>William Bernstein’s commonsense approach to portfolio construction has served investors well during the past turbulent decade―and it’s what made <i>The Four Pillars of Investing</i> an instant classic when it was first published nearly a decade ago.</p> <p>This down-to-earth book lays out in easy-to-understand prose the four essential topics that every investor must master: the relationship of risk and reward, the history of the market, the psychology of the investor and the market, and the folly of taking financial advice from investment salespeople.</p> <p>Bernstein pulls back the curtain to reveal what really goes on in today’s financial industry as he outlines a simple program for building wealth while controlling risk. Straightforward in its presentation and generous in its real-life examples, <i>The Four Pillars of Investing</i> presents a no-nonsense discussion of:</p> <ul> <li>The art and science of mixing different asset classes into an effective blend</li> <li>The dangers of actively picking stocks, as opposed to investing in the whole market</li> <li>Behavioral finance and how state of mind can adversely affect decision making</li> <li>Reasons the mutual fund and brokerage industries, rather than your partners, are often your most direct competitors</li> <li>Strategies for managing all of your assets―savings, 401(k)s, home equity―as one portfolio</li> </ul> <p>Investing is not a destination. It is a journey, and along the way are stockbrokers, journalists, and mutual fund companies whose interests are diametrically opposed to yours.</p> <p>More relevant today than ever, <i>The Four Pillars of Investing</i> shows you how to determine your own financial direction and assemble an investment program with the sole goal of building long-term wealth for you and your family.</p> - from Amzon","Development & Growth, Economic History, Money & Monetary Policy, Public Finance, Economics, Commodities, Introduction",""

He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence. <em>The God Delusion</em> makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.</div> - from Amzon","Philosophy, Atheism, History & Philosophy",""

From a western perspective the rise of the emergent business and professional class may seem very familiar. However, it is far from clear that those newly enriched by the processes of modernization in East and South East Asia are readily comparable with the middle classes of the West. For example, civil and human rights seem to play a different role in social, political and economic change, and the State is clearly more central as an agent of economic development. This volume is the essential introduction to the series, and identifies the 'new rich' phenomenon in Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The contributors demonstrate that the key to understanding the 'new rich' is to realise that they are neither a single category or class, but in each setting a series of different socio-political groups who have a common inheritance from the process of rapid economic growth. - from Amzon","Ethnic Studies, Sociology, Asian, Middle Eastern, Political Science, Sociology",""
