Meskipun dari segi pe lak sa­naan tergolong urusan dalam negeri, keseluruhan peristiwa tersebut ber­lang sung dalam konteks Perang Dingin global. Negara­negara asing bukanlah pengamat yang netral: Dalam rangka mengamankan kepentingan masing­masing, negara­negara itu memberikan dukungan kepada kelompok­kelompok Indonesia yang tengah bertikai--dan semuanya menyalahkan pihak lain atas tragedi yang terjadi.

On suspicion of having supported a communist coup, approximately 500,000 to 1,000,000 people were killed. So far the international dimension of those events is hardly explored. Although they were domestic by execution, they were also firmly embedded into the global Cold War. Foreign countries were anything but passive onlookers: They sided with Indonesian conflict parties and staked out their own claims--and they all blamed others for the tragedy.</i></div> - from Amzon",,

It explores the different ways in which culture affects disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and how disasters and risk influence culture. It examines why people choose to live in hazard-prone locations, and how culture and beliefs enable them to live with the risks they face. The report looks at the organizational culture of agencies working in the fields of disaster risk reduction and adaptation, and challenges the widespread faith in community-based activities. It also considers culture in relation to housing and reconstruction, and healthcare and medicine. Finally, the document indicates starting points for organizations to better align their actions with the way people think and act. The World Disasters Report 2014 features: (i) the links between culture and risk; (ii) how religion and beliefs influence perceptions of and attitudes towards risk; (iii) taking livelihoods seriously; (iv) the myth of community?; (v) culture, risk and the built environment; (vi) culturally sensitive public health: the HIV/AIDS disaster and beyond; (vii) putting culture at the centre of risk reduction; (viii) disaster data. - from Amzon",,

"A Certain Age: Colonial Jakarta through the Memories of Its Intellectuals","Rudolf Mrázek",,,,"Duke University Press Books",,2010,,0822346974,9780822346975,,F1,Unknown,,Book,"<div><I>A Certain Age</I> is an unconventional, evocative work of history and a moving reflection on memory, modernity, space, time, and the limitations of traditional historical narratives. Rudolf Mrázek visited Indonesia throughout the 1990s, recording lengthy interviews with elderly intellectuals in and around Jakarta. With few exceptions, they were part of an urban elite born under colonial rule and educated at Dutch schools. From the early twentieth century, through the late colonial era, the national revolution, and well into independence after 1945, these intellectuals injected their ideas of modernity, progress, and freedom into local and national discussion.</p><P>When Mrázek began his interviews, he expected to discuss phenomena such as the transition from colonialism to postcolonialism. His interviewees, however, wanted to share more personal recollections. Mrázek illuminates their stories of the past with evocative depictions of their late-twentieth-century surroundings. He brings to bear insights from thinkers including Walter Benjamin, Bertold Brecht, Le Corbusier, and Marcel Proust, and from his youth in Prague, another metropolis with its own experience of passages and revolution. Architectural and spatial tropes organize the book. Thresholds, windowsills, and sidewalks come to seem more apt as descriptors of historical transitions than colonial and postcolonial, or modern and postmodern. Asphalt roads, homes, classrooms, fences, and windows organize movement, perceptions, and selves in relation to others. <I>A Certain Age</I> is a portal into questions about how the past informs the present and how historical accounts are inevitably partial and incomplete.</div> - from Amzon","Southeast Asia, Cultural, Asia, Anthropology",

He leaves a positive but in some ways ambiguous legacy in political terms. His most conspicuous achievement was the survival of hereditary Yoqyakartan kingship, and he provided rare stability and continuity in Indonesia's highly fractured modern history. Under the New Order, Hamengku Buwono also helped to launch the Indonesian economy on a much stronger growth path. Although remembered as the epitome of ""political decency"", he faded from power and influence as Vice President in the 1970s, and the repressive and anti-democratic features of Suharto's New Order seemed to contradict much of what Hamengku Buwono originally stood for.

"Alvar Aalto: The Complete Catalogue of Architecture, Design, and Art","Goran Schildt",,,,Rizzoli,,1994,,0847818187,9780847818181,,J3,Architecture,,Book,"One of the masters of modern architecture, Alvar Aalto (1898-1976) was a prolific and influential architect, a gifted painter, and a talented, world-renowned designer. In this comprehensive catalogue all his known works from the early 1920s to his final designs in the 1970s are presented and described. With the full cooperation of the Alvar Aalto Foundation, Goran Schildt has explored its archives, and some 20,000 letters, memoranda and contemporary newspaper cuttings as well as many building models, to ensure that every work is included in this volume. It contains full descriptions, accompanied by abundant illustrations, of all of Aalto's realized and unrealized architectural projects: regional and urban plans, churches, theaters, libraries, museums, office and factory buildings, public housing, and private residences. Aalto's design skill is prominently featured in his furniture, light fixtures, glass, objets d'art, textiles, jewelry, graphic design, and stage sets. The present volume catalogues Aalto's vast oeuvre, including many projects never before seen by the public, and uncovers information about Aalto's competition entries, his clients and colleagues, that is crucial to a complete understanding of Aalto's visionary impact on modern architecture, art, and design. - from Amzon","Individual Architects & Firms, History, Furniture, Architecture",

Grayling",,,,"Bloomsbury Publishing PLC",,2007,,0747586039,9780747586036,,H2,Unknown,,Book,"Britain and the USA carried out a massive bombing offensive against the cities of Germany and Japan in the course of the Second World War, which ended with the destruction of Hamburg, Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Was the bombing of civilian targets justified by the necessities of war? Or was it, in fact, a crime against humanity? How should we, the descendants of the Allies who won the victory in that war, reply to the moral challenge of the descendants of those whose cities were targeted? A.C. Grayling looks at the stands people took, both for and against, and crucially asks what the lessons are that we can learn for today about how people should behave in a world of tension and moral confusion, of terrorism and fragile democracies. ""Among the Dead Cities"" is both a lucid and revealing work of modern history and an investigation of conscience into one of the last remaining controversies of that time. - from Amzon",,

Together with his brother Leon, he has perfected a form of presentation in which the potency of his thinking finds its perfect counterpoint in detailed drawings and sketches which argue his case visually through the power of example. Following the success of his widely acclaimed <i>Urban Space</i>, a work which looked at the problems of our cities from a historical, theoretical and practical standpoint, Krier now applies his particular, highly influential mode of didactic criticism to contemporary architecture in a continuing search for fundamental architectural truths.<br><br><i>Architectural Composition</i> is both a theortetical and visual analysis which clearly illustrates the creative process which informs Krier's vision and praxis. The culmination of a lifetime's thought and experience by one of Europe's most important architectural theorists, it is without doubt a major achievement and will become a standard work of reference for both students and practising architects.<br></div> - from Amzon",,

The book shows how architecture and urban space can be seen, both historically and theoretically, as representations of political and cultural tendencies that characterize an emerging as well as a declining social order. It addresses the complex interactions between public memories of the present and past, between images of global urban cultures and the concrete historical meanings of the local. It shows how one might write a political history of postcolonial architecture and urban space that recognizes the political cultures of the present without neglecting the importance of the colonial past. In the process, it poses serious questions for the analysis and understanding of postcolonial states. - from Amzon","Buildings, Criticism, World, Study & Teaching, Urban Planning & Development, City Planning & Urban Development, History, Architecture, Public Policy",

The book explores current social, economic and environmental issues in America with a particular focus on marginalized and underserved communities.<br><I>By the People</I> features design projects organized into six working themes: Act, Save, Share, Live, Learn and Make. It is a true manual--in format and content--featuring design solutions that expand access to education, food, health care and affordable housing; increase social and economic inclusion; offer improved alternative transportation options, and provide a balanced approach to land use between the built and natural environments. Cooper Hewitt Curator Cynthia E. Smith traveled to post-industrial cities, urban areas impacted by natural disasters, sprawling cities, places of persistent poverty and major metropolitan regions. Her research yielded nearly 400 potential projects from over 30 states and three indigenous nations (Navajo, Lakota, Pueblo).<br>Smith met with local designers, community members and organizations. Her research was guided by the following questions: where does poverty exist? Why are poverty numbers increasing? What populations and communities are most affected? Who are the individuals, organizations and networks that are creating innovative and systemic approaches through design? What are the local, regional and scalable design solutions?<br>In addition to the highly illustrated project profiles, <I>By the People</I> contains essays by, and interviews with, those designers and architects building the innovative and systemic approaches being developed through design. - from Amzon","Sustainability & Green Design, Industrial & Product Design",

Peter Hall shows the benevolent influence of the anarchist ideals of Reclus and Kropotkin in the work of Howard, Geddes and Lloyd Wright, which found expression in garden cities and community planning. He contrasts this with the totalitarian vision of Le Corbusier which, spurned by Mussolini and Stalin, was enthusiastically taken up by countless city authorities in Europe and America. He explores the nightmare cities of Brasilia and Chandigarh and seeks the origins of the high-rise slums and vandalized spaces that afflict the lives of so many people. Planners have become the handmaidens of business, architects the designers of spectacle: both have retreated from any active interest in real, social achievement. Meanwhile the threat to civilized life represented on the one hand by the despair and resentment of the urban underclass and on the other by uncontrolled demolition and development, remains as real and as intractable as ever. Peter Hall is author of over 20 books on planning and related subjects including ""London 2000"", ""The World Cities"" ""Great Planning Disasters"" and ""High Tech America"". He has been credited with the invention of the ""urban enterprise zone"" concept. He is widely known throughout the west for his contributions both to the practice and to the theory of city and regional planning. - from Amzon","Arts & Photography, France, Germany, Historiography",

In <i> Civic Realism</i>, Peter G. Rowe looks at the shape and appearance of civic places, and at the social, political, and cultural circumstances that bring them into existence. The book is as much about the making and reshaping of civic places as it is about urban architecture per se. According to Rowe, the best civic place-making occurs across the divide between the state and civil society. By contrast, the alternatives are not very attractive. On the one side are state-sponsored edifices and places of authoritarian nature. On the other are the exclusive enclaves of corporate-dominated urban and suburban environments.</p> - from Amzon","Buildings, Urban & Land Use Planning, Architecture, Architecture",

"Classical Language of Architecture (World of Art)","John Summerson",,,,"W. W. Norton & Company",Revised,1980,,0500201773,9780500201770,,J2,Unknown,,Book,"Classical architecture is a visual ""language"" and like any other language has its own grammatical rules. Classical buildings as widely spaced in time as a Roman temple, an Italian Renaissance palace and a Regency house all show an awareness of these rules even if they vary them, break them or poetically contradict them. Sir Christopher Wren described them as the ""Latin"" of architecture and the analogy is almost exact. There is the difference, however, that whereas the learning of Latin is a slow and difficult business, the language of classical architecture is relatively simple. It is still, to a great extent, the mode of expression of our urban surroundings, since classical architecture was the common language of the western world till comparatively recent times. Anybody to whom architecture makes a strong appeal has probably already discovered something of its grammar for himself.in this book, the author's purpose is to set out as simply and vividly as possible the exact grammatical workings of this architectural language. He is less concerned with its development in Greece and Rome than with its expansion and use in the centuries since the Renaissance. He explains the vigorous discipline of ""the orders"" and the scope of ""rustication""; the dramatic deviations of the Baroque and, in the last chapter, the relationship between the classical tradition and the ""modern"" architecture of today. The book is intended for anybody who cares for architecture but more specifically for students beginning a course in the history of architecture, to whom a guide to the classical rules will be an essential companion. - from Amzon","Buildings, History, Architecture",

Lozano strives to unify theory and practice, seeing that design at community scale is a relatively new responsibility for professionals and seeing the need for an awareness of the systemic nature of urban design.  He also highlights relevant lessons from historical examples in order to rediscover the community design metier forgotten after the industrial revolution.  The author relies on interdisciplinary studies, drawing from biology, ecology, and political science, as well as from history for his fascinating study.  Throughout the book there is an emphasis on the interrelationship of design and culture--society, technology, institutions, and values--and on the need for an agenda for political and cultural change. - from Amzon","Architecture, Architecture, Specific Demographics, Rural, Architecture",

The simple step by step procedures outlining the processes, tools and techniques for collecting and assessing the cultural assets and resources of any community provide the user with a clear methodology to unravel the complex and significant elements which wake up any human settlement. This has been further demonstrated with the illustration from a case study of cultural mapping within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of George Town, Penang. The manual is a remarkable resource which advocates that cultural mapping becomes the basis for all future urban planning studies to ensure that sensitive and appropriate decisions are made in the management and development of historic sites and communities.

During their training following the recruitment, their dreams assume colours and shapes. They leave their homeland with high hopes and aspirations.  Arriving at their destinations, the workers quickly realize that no amount of training can prepare them for the shock of the cold, foreign world which confronts them. Those who are placed with considerate employers have generally happy working lives. Those who are placed with employers who expect ready-to-use service from their domestic helpers have a long and rocky road to navigate. With very little bargaining power and negotiating skills, as well as social prejudice from many parts of the community, these women's dreams can easily turn into nightmares.   In Dreamseekers: Indonesian Women as Domestic Workers in Asia, veteran journalist Dewi Anggraeni uncovers the hidden world of domestic helpers from all points of view: the employers, the agents, the governments, the NGOs, and most importantly the workers themselves. This first-hand account of the struggles and successes of these women is described in vivid detail, and Dreamseekers is a must-read by anyone interested in the plight of these remarkable women.  About the Author Dewi Anggraeni, a native of Jakarta, is a journalist and novelist now residing in Melbourne. She is the Australia correspondent for Tempo and regular contributor to the Jakarta Post. Her works have been published in Australia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, the USA, the UK, and Malaysia. Dewi has also published seven books, the latest being Who Did This to our Bali and a novel, Snake, (2003, Indra Publishing).

Unique in the literature is the book’s insight that the <i>form</i> of the city really matters – and that it is within our ability to change it, and crucial that we do.

Daly",,,,"Island Press",1,2003,,1559633123,9781559633123,,G1,Unknown,,Book,"<p>Conventional economics is often criticized for failing to reflect adequately the value of clean air and water, species diversity, and social and generational equity. By excluding biophysical and social systems from their analyses, many conventional economists overlook problems of the increasing scale of human impacts and the inequitable distribution of resources.<p>Ecological Economics is an introductory-level textbook for an emerging paradigm that addresses this flaw in much economic thought. The book defines a revolutionary ""transdiscipline"" that incorporates insights from the biological, physical, and social sciences, and it offers a pedagogically complete examination of this exciting new field. The book provides students with a foundation in traditional neoclassical economic thought, but places that foundation within a new interdisciplinary framework that embraces the linkages among economic growth, environmental degradation, and social inequity.<p>Introducing the three core issues that are the focus of the new transdiscipline -- scale, distribution, and efficiency -- the book is guided by the fundamental question, often assumed but rarely spoken in traditional texts: What is really important to us? After explaining the key roles played by the earth's biotic and abiotic resources in sustaining life, the text is then organized around the main fields in traditional economics: microeconomics, macroeconomics, and international economics. The book also takes an additional step of considering the policy implications of this line of thinking.<p><I>Ecological Economics</I> includes numerous features that make it accessible to a wide range of students:<ul><li> more than thirty text boxes that highlight issues of special importance to students<li> lists of key terms that help students organize the main points in each chapter<li> concise definitions of new terms that are highlighted in the text for easy reference<li> study questions that encourage student exploration beyond the text<li> glossary and list of further readings</ul><p>An accompanying workbook presents an innovative, applied problem-based learning approach to teaching economics.<p>While many books have been written on ecological economics, and several textbooks describe basic concepts of the field, this is the only stand-alone textbook that offers a complete explanation of both theory and practice. It will serve an important role in educating a new generation of economists and is an invaluable new text for undergraduate and graduate courses in ecological economics, environmental economics, development economics, human ecology, environmental studies, sustainability science, and community development. - from Amzon","Environmental Economics, Sustainable Development, Biology, Ecology, Economics, Business Development, Ecology",

Using a variety of modeling techniques (including econometric, partial and general equilibrium, and input-output models) and applying them to a wide range of materials, economic sectors, and countries, these studies analyze the driving forces behind material flows and structural changes in order to offer guidance for economically and socially feasible policy solutions.</p><p>After a survey of concepts and relevant research that provides a useful background for the chapters that follow, the book presents historical analyses of structural change from statistical and decomposition approaches; a range of models that predict structural change on the national and regional scale under different policy scenarios; two models that can be used to analyze waste management and recycling operations; and, adopting the perspective of local scale, an analysis of the dynamics of eco-industrial parks in Denmark and the Netherlands. The book concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of an economic approach to industrial ecology.</p> - from Amzon","Environmental Economics, Environmental, Ecology, Environmental Science, Essays & Commentary, Environment",

Today, with the US promising an endless war against terrorism and promoting a policy of preemptive defense, this notion seems more plausible than ever. <br><br>But what does imperialism mean in the absence of colonial conquest and direct imperial rule? In this lucid and lively book Ellen Meiksins Wood explores the new imperialism against the contrasting background of older forms, from ancient Rome, through medieval Europe, the Arab Muslim world, the Spanish conquests, and the Dutch commercial empire. Tracing the birth of a capitalist imperialism back to the English domination of Ireland, Wood follows its development through the British Empire in America and India. <br><br>The book brings into sharp relief the nature of today’s new capitalist empire, in which the political reach of imperial power cannot match its economic hegemony, and the global economy is administered not by a global state but by a system of multiple local states, policed by the most disproportionately powerful military force the world has ever known and enforced according to a new military doctrine of war without end, in purpose or time. - from Amzon","Free Enterprise, Economics, World, History & Theory, Globalization",

Since 1968, when the concept of a 'clean and green garden city' was first introduced, Singapore's political leadership has taken an active role in managing the environmental impact of urban growth and industrialization, achieving a balance between conservation and development. The aim, in the words of then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, is to become ""a city worthy of an industrious people whose quest for progress is matched by their appreciation for the beauty of nature.""

The automobile, the effects of the Modern Movement in architectural design, urban-renewal and zoning policies, the dominance of private over public interests, as well as changes in land use in the inner city have resulted in the loss of values and meanings that were traditionally associated with urban open space. This text offers a comprehensive and systematic examination of the crisis of the contemporary city and the means by which this crisis can be addressed. Finding Lost Space traces leading urban spatial design theories that have emerged over the past eighty years: the principles of Sitte and Howard; the impact of and reactions to the Functionalist movement; and designs developed by Team 10, Robert Venturi, the Krier brothers, and Fumihiko Maki, to name a few. In addition to discussions of historic precedents, contemporary approaches to urban spatial design are explored. Detailed case studies of Boston, Massachusetts; Washington, D.C.; Goteborg, Sweden; and the Byker area of Newcastle, England demonstrate the need for an integrated design approach--one that considers figure-ground, linkage, and place theories of urban spatial design. These theories and their individual strengths and weaknesses are defined and applied in the case studies, demonstrating how well they operate in different contexts. This text will prove invaluable for students and professionals in the fields of architecture, landscape architecture, and city planning. Finding Lost Space is going to be a primary text for the urban designers of the next generation. It is the first book in the field to absorb the lessons of the postmodern reaction, including the work of the Krier brothers and many others, and to integrate these into a coherent theory and set of design guidelines. Without polemics, Roger Trancik addresses the biggest issue in architecture and urbanism today: how can we regain in our shattered cities a public realm that is made of firmly shaped, coherently linked, humanly meaningful urban spaces?

Rubbing two sticks together produces heat and light; one stick alone is just a stick. In both cases, it is friction that produces movement, action, effect. Challenging the widespread view that globalization invariably signifies a ""clash"" of cultures, anthropologist Anna Tsing here develops friction in its place as a metaphor for the diverse and conflicting social interactions that make up our contemporary world. </p><br> <p>She focuses on one particular ""zone of awkward engagement""--the rainforests of Indonesia--where in the 1980s and the 1990s capitalist interests increasingly reshaped the landscape not so much through corporate design as through awkward chains of legal and illegal entrepreneurs that wrested the land from previous claimants, creating resources for distant markets. In response, environmental movements arose to defend the rainforests and the communities of people who live in them. Not confined to a village, a province, or a nation, the social drama of the Indonesian rainforest includes local and national environmentalists, international science, North American investors, advocates for Brazilian rubber tappers, UN funding agencies, mountaineers, village elders, and urban students, among others--all combining in unpredictable, messy misunderstandings, but misunderstandings that sometimes work out.</p><br> <p>Providing a portfolio of methods to study global interconnections, Tsing shows how curious and creative cultural differences are in the grip of worldly encounter, and how much is overlooked in contemporary theories of the global.</p><br> - from Amzon","Environmental Economics, Social Sciences, General, Globalization, Environmental Policy",

Led by The Why Factory, the global urbanist thinktank headed by Winy Maas, experts in the field debate what is currently considered green and how the term ought to be defined going forward, challenging architectural conventions and looking into the potential of new green architecture. Recognizing that green buildings alone do not make a green city, <I>Green Dream </I>also looks at broader green solutions for cities and how they might be implemented. Most importantly of all, the book dares to ask ""Is a green city actually feasible?"" and attempts to answer this question through the help of case studies. Drawing on 36 illustrated green projects, and with essays by John Thackara and Winy Maas, this volume outlines future goals for architectural and urban projects, and draws on research by The Why Factory, MVRDV and Delft University of Technology. - from Amzon","Urban & Land Use Planning, Sustainability & Green Design",

Mougeot",,,,"International Development Research Centre Books",PAP/CDR,2006,,1552502260,9781552502266,,E2,Unknown,,Book,"The UN predicts that over the next twenty-five years nearly all population growth will be in the cities of the developing world. At current rates, sixty percent of the world’s total population will live in cities by 2030. <br /><br />As the cities grow, so does the number of urban poor. Unemployment, hunger, and malnutrition are commonplace. In the big city, most of any cash income the poor might bring home goes to feeding themselves and staying alive; any food that does not have to be bought is a bonus. As a result, more and more people are attempting to grow at least some of their own food to supplement poor diets and meager incomes. But farming in the city ― urban agriculture ― is too often seen by municipalities as a problem to be eradicated rather than as a part of the solution to making the city and its environment more sustainable.<br /><br />In fact, urban agriculture has a long history. Throughout the developing world, municipal policymakers are waking to the fact that properly managed agriculture can make a major contribution to a city’s food security. It also has potential to provide employment, improve the environment, and make productive use of vacant spaces within the city. More than twenty years ago, IDRC became the first international agency to formally support research on urban agriculture. This book reviews the research experience of IDRC and its partners, including local governments, into the issues surrounding urban agriculture, with a particular emphasis on the influence that research has had on government policies. It describes the growth of city networks in Africa and Latin America that focus on accommodating urban agriculture and improving the lot of urban food producers. And it offers specific recommendations aimed at helping policymakers at all levels of government to maximize the potential of urban agriculture. The book concludes with a vision of how such policies might transform cities in the near future.<br /><br />This book serves as a focal point for an IDRC thematic Web site on urban agriculture. The full text is available online and leads the reader into a virtual web of resources that explores two decades of research into this important issue.<br /><br />This book is available in Spanish. - from Amzon","Social Sciences, Urban, Globalization, Sociology",

"History of Modern Architecture Volume 2 The Modern Movement","Leonardo Benevolo",,,,"The MIT Press","First MIT Press Paperback Edition",1977,,0262520451,9780262520454,,J2,Architecture,,Book,"<P>Let it be said at once that the format of this work is richly handsome: it is a two-volume boxed set comprising 844 pages and well over 1,000 high-quality illustrations, and it reflects throughout its publisher's conviction that good design is an essential, not superficial, part of bookmaking.Beyond that, it should be emphasized that this work is not another facile cultural tour of modern architecture. It is a serious and original study of the beginnings and development of modernism in which the pictorial aspects are designed to aid in the communication of the author's closely reasoned formulations, rather than to gloss over a lack of substantive content.The book is a translation of the third Italian edition, published in 1966. Benevolo, who is on the faculty of architecture in Venice, has earned an international reputation as a historian of architecture and town planning, and his publications embrace the span of time from the Renaissance to the foreseeable future. One such publication, The Origins of Modern Town Planning (The MIT Press, 1967), may be read as a prelude to the present work as well as an independent contribution. Perhaps more than any other architectural historian in our time, Benevolo has made a determined effort to place developments in design and planning in their proper social and political settings.Indeed, the author argues that the development of the modern movement in architecture was determined, not by aesthetic formalisms, but largely by the social changes that have occurred since about 1760: ""After the middle of the eighteenth century, without the continuity of formal activity being in any way broken, indeed while architectural language seems to be acquiring a particular coherence, the relations between architect and society began to change radically.... New material and spiritual needs, new ideas and modes of procedure arise both within and beyond the traditional limits, and finally they run together to form a new architectural synthesis that is completely different from the old one. In this way it is possible to explain the birth of modern architecture, which otherwise would seem completely incomprehensible....""This second volume is concerned with the modern movement proper, from 1914 to 1966. The author emphasizes the unity of the movement, rejecting the usual treatment that allots to the individual architects separate and unconnected biographical accounts.Benevolo remarks at one point, ""When one talks about modern architecture one must bear in mind the fact that it implies not only a new range of forms, but also a new way of thinking, whose consequences have not yet all been calculated."" His main concern is to provide a more exact calculation of those consequences.</P> - from Amzon","History, History, History, Architecture, History, Architecture",

They are, writes David Bornstein, the driven, creative individuals who question the status quo, exploit new opportunities, refuse to give up--and remake the world for the better. <br> <em>How to Change the World</em> tells the fascinating stories of these remarkable individuals--many in the United States, others in countries from Brazil to Hungary--providing an <em>In Search of Excellence</em> for the nonprofit sector. In America, one man, J.B. Schramm, has helped thousands of low-income high school students get into college. In South Africa, one woman, Veronica Khosa, developed a home-based care model for AIDS patients that changed government health policy. In Brazil, Fabio Rosa helped bring electricity to hundreds of thousands of remote rural residents. Another American, James Grant, is credited with saving 25 million lives by leading and 'marketing' a global campaign for immunization. Yet another, Bill Drayton, created a pioneering foundation, Ashoka, that has funded and supported these social entrepreneurs and over a thousand like them, leveraging the power of their ideas across the globe. <br> These extraordinary stories highlight a massive transformation that is going largely unreported by the media: Around the world, the fastest-growing segment of society is the nonprofit sector, as millions of ordinary people--social entrepreneurs--are increasingly stepping in to solve the problems where governments and bureaucracies have failed. <em>How to Change the World</em> shows, as its title suggests, that with determination and innovation, even a single person can make a surprising difference. For anyone seeking to make a positive mark on the world, this will be both an inspiring read and an invaluable handbook. - from Amzon","Volunteer Work, Entrepreneurship, Philanthropy & Charity, Politics & Government, Economics, Entrepreneurship, Political Science",

But what if we thought of popular districts in more expansive ways that capture what really goes on within them?

"Indonesia: The Rise of Capital (Asian Studies Association of Australia)","Richard Robison",,,,"Allen & Unwin",,1986,,0049090240,9780049090248,,H2,Unknown,,Book,"Studies of Indonesian politics have long focused upon the military and the bureaucracy because it is within these institutions that formal power is located, not the parties, unions, chambers of commerce or corporations. However, such an approach can neglect the powerful influences exerted upon the state by social and economic forces. This important and controversial new book examines the way in which one of these forces, capital, has emerged in the past two decades as a major influence upon the state, its officials and policies.  The emergence of the capitalist class is examined, along with its internal divisions and conflicts and its relations with the state. In particular, attention is given to the fusion of the ruling strata of state officials and the capitalist class – the potential basis for a new ruling class. This is set against the weakness of capital caused by its division into domestic and international, state and private, Chinese and indigenous. These factors are in turn set in the context of international influences – the rise and fall of the oil boom, the activities of the IBRD and IMF, the decline of export earnings and the fiscal difficulties of the state. Since its original publication in 1986, Indonesia: The Rise of Capital has been the best selling academic book on Indonesian politics and the most cited in the SSCI and Google Scholar citation indexes. <p> About the Author<p> At the time of this publication in 1986, Richard Robison was Senior Lecturer in the Asian Studies Program at Murdoch University. He is now Emeritus Professor at Murdoch University and has been Professor of Political Economy at the International Institute of Social Studies in The Hague (2003–2006) and Professor and Director of the Australian Research Council’s Special Centre for Research on Political and Social Change in Contemporary Asia (1995–1999). He is the author, editor of 14 books and has published in major international journals, including World Politics, World Development, Pacific Review, New Political Economy and the Journal of Development Studies. Professor Robison has been awarded Senior research fellowships from the Fulbright Foundation and the Leverhulme Trust. - from Amzon","Economic History, Economics",

Both disciplines have something to say about instigating environmental improvement and more sustainable futures. IE is predicated on the idea that social and economic systems mirror, or should be made to mirror, natural ecological systems. Proponents of IE devise models and techniques to trace material and energy resource flows as they move through social and economic systems. They propose policy and management improvements to increase the resource efficiency of such systems. By contrast, IS researchers work with the idea that innovation is a dynamic activity, vital to social and economic change and is shaped by a range of actors in industry, in government and in households. The authors illustrate the conceptual and practical problems and opportunities of working across this bi-disciplinary interface, with case studies presented from each and from hybrid perspectives that draw on both. These include applied examples from IE such as an evaluation of industrial symbiosis in the UK and from working projects in industrialising countries. Cases that originate with IS cover the areas of food, construction and waste incineration. New directions for conceptual development and further research are also offered. Conceptual blindspots and research gaps are identified at the interface of the two disciplines. Industrial Ecology and Spaces of Innovation will appeal to a wide and interdisciplinary audience including academics and researchers of environmental innovation, management and economics, industrial ecology and schools of environmental engineering. Business environmental practitioners, consultants and managers working with techniques such as life-cycle analysis, environmental impact assessment and collaborative industrial symbiosis initiatives will also find much to engage them within this book. - from Amzon","Economics, International, Industrial, Ecology, International Business, Ecology",

"Informal Politics: Street Vendors and the State in Mexico City","John C. Cross",,,,"Stanford University Press",1,1998,,0804730628,9780804730624,,E1,Unknown,,Book,"As economic crises struck the Third World in the 1970s and 1980s, large segments of the population turned to the informal economy to survive. Though this phenomenon has previously been analyzed from a strictly economic point of view, this book looks at street vending in the largest city in the world, Mexico City, as a political process. Employing a street-level analysis based on intensive participant observation, with interviews, archival research, and surveys, the author presents a view of political processes that provides new theoretical insights into social movements, state institutions, and politics at the fringe of society, where legality blurs into illegality and the informal economy intersects with its political counterpoint―informal politics. By studying political processes at the street level and then tracing them up the political structure, the author also reveals the basic processes by which the Mexican state operates. Street vendors have been successful in defending their interests in Mexico City, the author argues, because they are able to take advantage of certain structural features of the Mexican state, notably the weak integration of interests between policy-makers and policy-implementers. The author shows that when well-organized, street vendors can collude with state policy-implementers even when state policy-makers are influenced by powerful interest groups, such as large national and multinational corporations. The book develops a systematic theory of the “political economy of economic informality” while raising new questions and theories about the state and social movements. Though the direct research is confined to the Mexican case study, the author suggests ways in which his conclusions can be applied to other developing areas in the Third World. - from Amzon","Economic Conditions, Education & Reference, Government & Business, Urban, Political Science, Political Economy, Business & Finance, Political Science, Sociology",

The book starts with nature itself and then leads readers to examine the built environment and then specific technologies in areas such as public health and energy.</p><p>Each part focuses on a single environmental issue. Topics range widely, from the role of innovation in urban landscapes to the relationship among technological innovation, public health, and the environment. Each part features an essay by a historian, an essay by a practitioner, and a ""portrait of innovation"" describing an individual whose work has made a difference. The mixture of historians and practitioners is critical because statements about the environment inevitably measure present and future conditions against those of the past. Early in the industrial revolution, smoke stacks were symbols of prosperity; at its end they were regarded as signs of pollution. Historical examples can also lead to the rediscovery of an old technology, as in the revival of straw bale construction. As it explores the history of invention for the environment, the book suggests many new ways to put the past to use for the common good.</p> - from Amzon","Economics, Environmental, Ecology, Environmental Science, Environment",

Included is a wealth of information on the daily life, art, customs and religion of this magical ""Island of the Gods."" In the author's own words it presents a ""bird's-eye view of Balinese life and culture.""<BR><BR>Miguel Covarrubias, the author, was a noted painter and caricaturist as well as a student of anthropology. He lived in Bali for a total of three years in the early 1930s, and today his account is as fresh and insightful as it was when it was originally published. Introducing the island with a survey of hits history, geography and social structure, Covarrubias goes on to present a captivating picture of Balinese art, music and drama. Religion, witchcraft, death and cremation are also covered.<BR><BR><i>Island of Bali</i> will appeal to anyone with an interest in this unique island, from general <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> readers to serious anthropologist alike. Complementing the text are 90 drawings by Covarrubias and countless others by Balinese artists. Also included are 114 half-tone photographs, and five full-color paintings by the author. - from Amzon","Southeast Asia, Bali, Southeast, Cultural, Globalization",
"Istanbul: Memories of a City","Orhan Pamuk",,,,"Faber And Faber","Later Printing",2017,,0571218334,9780571218332,,F1,Unknown,,Book,"A portrait, by turns intimate and panoramic, of one of the world’s great cities, by its foremost man of letters, author of the acclaimed novels <i>Snow</i> and <i>My Name Is Red</i>.<br><br>Blending reminiscence with history; family photographs with portraits of poets and pashas; art criticism, metaphysical musing, and, now and again, a fanciful tale, Orhan Pamuk invents an ingenious form to evoke his lifelong home, the city that forged his imagination.  He begins with his childhood among the eccentric extended Pamuk family in the dusty, carpeted, and hermetically sealed apartment building they shared. In this place came his first intimations of the melancholy awareness that binds all residents of his city together: that of living in the seat of ruined imperial glories, in a country trying to become “modern” at the dizzying crossroads of East and West. This elegiac communal spirit overhangs Pamuk’s reflections as he introduces the writers and painters (among the latter, most particularly the German Antoine-Ignace Melling) through whose eyes he came to see Istanbul. Against a background of shattered monuments, neglected villas,  ghostly backstreets, and, above all, the fabled waters of the Bosphorus, he presents the interplay of his budding sense of place with that of his predecessors. And he charts the evolution of a rich, sometimes macabre, imaginative life, which furnished a daydreaming boy refuge from family discord and inner turmoil, and which would continue to serve the famous writer he was to become. It was, and remains, a life fed by the changing microcosm of the apartment building and, even more, the beckoning kaleidoscope beyond its walls. <br><br>As much a portrait of the artist as a young man as it is an oneiric Joycean map of the city, <i>Istanbul</i> is a masterful evocation of its subject through the idiosyncrasies of direct experience as much as the power of myth--the dazzling book Pamuk was born to write. - from Amzon","Authors, Memoirs, Travel, Istanbul, General, Travel Writing",
"Itsuko Hasegawa (Architectural Monographs No 31)","Itsuko Hasegawa",,,,Wiley,1st,1993,,1854902032,9781854902030,,J1,Unknown,,Book,"In 1964 Hasegawa graduated from the Department of Architecture, Kanto Gakuin University, the strongest formalist school in Japan. Since then she has challenged the current tendency to analyze in a formalist way. Koji's essay suggests that Hasegawa's work should be viewed in social terms. He dismisses those who see only a gaudy facade, asserting that Hasegawa's work should not be regarded simply as stimulating design Hasegawa recognizes the potential for society's transformation. Her dialogue-based programme allows for an empathetic approach to architecture. In her own essay, she cites the Shiranui Psychiatric Hospital and Stress Care Centre in Ohmuta, where she and the client discussed for three years the relationship between architecture and medical care, to ensure a holistic architectural response. This experimental therapeutic space was achieved through use of light reflected from the sea, which also registers the natural rhythm of the tides. Similarly, for the Shonandai Cultural Centre, Hasegawa involved the local residents in close communication with the design team. Through her reciprocal method of planning, she provides a flexible type of architecture which accepts a diversity of individuals. - from Amzon","Individual Architects & Firms, International, Architecture",

Each grapples with Jakarta's housing culture, the experience of private as opposed to public space and the consequences of city migration, as well as the city's infrastructure, increasing density, and its coherence--or lack thereof--as a whole. As megalopolises in developing countries undergo explosive growth, their cultural, social, political and economic complexities are developing at unprecedented rates. That phenomenon is drawing more and more attention within the world of architecture and art, and <I>Jakarta Megalopolis</I> offers a case study of its complexities, a cutaway view of this chaotic new world. - from Amzon","Individual Architects & Firms, History, Installations, Mixed Media, Graphic Design, Architecture, Architecture, Art History",

Alongside its megastructures, high-rise residential buildings, and franchised convenience stores, Jakarta’s massive slums and off-hour street markets foster an unsettled urban population surviving in difficult conditions. But where does the vast middle of urban life fit into this dichotomy?

Set in a place that on the surface seems remarkably dysfunctional, Simone guides readers through urban spaces and encounters, detailing households, institutions, markets, mosques, and schools.

"Kelisanan dan Keberaksaraan dalam Surat Kabar Terbitan Awal di Minangkabau (1859 (Indonesian Edition)","Sastri Sunarti",,,,"Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia",,2013,,9799106559,9789799106551,,I1,Unknown,,Book,"Sinopsis: Ranah Minangkabau telah melahirkan tokoh dan surat kabar penting dalam sejarah pers nasional. Di antaranya adalah Rohana Koedoes, Lim Soen Hin, Dja Endar Moeda, Datuk Sutan Maharadja dan surat kabar Soenting Melaju, Pertja Barat, Al-Moenir, Oetoesan Melajoe. Sayang, kajian tentang perkembangan dunia pers di Sumatera Barat masih terbatas jumlahnya. Buku ini mengkaji terbitan awal surat kabar dan majalah yang terbit di ranah Minangkabau mulai pertengahan abad ke-19 hingga pertengahan abad ke-20. Namun, berbeda dengan para sarjana komunikasi atau jurnalistik, penulis mencoba mengkaji dengan sudut pandang lintas media mengenai keunikan terbitanterbitan Minangkabau, yang ditandai dengan keterkaitan antara kelisanan dan keberaksaraan. Dengan demikian, kajian ini menyodorkan dua hal penting baik bagi dunia pers nasional maupun bagi perkembangan kesastraan Indonesia. Pertama, kajian ini mengisi potongan-potongan yang selama ini kosong dalam mozaik perkembangan pers Nusantara yang masih didominasi oleh terbitan di Pulau Jawa. Kedua, yang lebih penting, kajian ini memperlihatkan, dua dunia yang selama ini seolah terpisah, antara tradisi keberaksaraan dan tradisi kelisanan, nyatanya sangat erat terkait. Kelisanan sebagai satu medium, memiliki sistem yang sama sekali berbeda dengan sistem yang terdapat dalam keberaksaraan. Kita tidak dapat melihat keunggulan kelisanan jika belum berhasil menorobos hadangan keberaksaraan. Surat kabar terbitan awal di Minangkabau memperlihatkan adanya interaksi dalam kedua medium ini melalui beberapa ciri kelisanan yang disampaikan oleh Walter J. Ong, ilmuwan komunikasi dan Amin Sweeney, peneliti terkemuka di bidang kesusastraan Melayu.

Verlag",,2015,,0993907415,9780993907418,,K1,Ecology,,Book,"intercalations 2 - LAND & ANIMAL & NONANIMAL - ... is an ensemble which contends that the meaning of the Anthropocene is less a geological re-formation than it is trans-formation of both land and animal; once exposed to some of the parameters defining this transition, the reader-as-exhibition-viewer may begin to discern erratic rhythms generated by the creatures of nonconformity that inhabit, with their violence, struggles, and love the vast, machinic reality called Earth. Land & Animal & Nonanimal turns the attention from the built space of cultural repositories to the postnatural landscapes of planet Earth. In his interview about urban soils of the Anthropocene, landscape architect Seth Denizen considers a history of land use practices that is also reflected in artist Robert Zhao Renhui's photographs of Singapore as a scenario of continuous development. Inspired by a recent visit to the environment of Wendover in the Utah desert, Richard Pell and Lauren Allen of Pittsburgh's Center for PostNatural History make a case for a postnatural imprint upon the geologic aspects inherent in the concept of the Anthropocene. By encountering ""the last snail,"" environmental historian and philosopher Thom van Dooren considers the meaning of hope and care in the context of species extinction. And while curator Natasha Ginwala's paginated series with contributions by Bianca Baldi, Arvo Leo, Axel Staschnoy, and Karthik Pandian & Andros Zins-Browne turns to cosmological and ancestral human-animal scenarios, sound artist and researcher Mitchell Akiyama explores philosophies of consciousness against the background of the phonogram in nineteenth-century simian research.

In this book from the Worldwatch Institute, Sandra Postel explains that decades of profligacy and mismanagement of the world's water resources have produced signs of shortages and environmental destruction. She writes with authority and clarity of the limits-ecological, economic, and political-of this vital natural resource. She explores the potential for conflict over water between nations, and between urban and rural residents. And she offers a sensible way out of such struggles. <em>Last Oasis</em> makes clear that the technologies and know-how exist to increase the productivity of every liter of water. But citizens must first understand the issues and insist on policies, laws, and institutions that promote the sustainable use of water. - from Amzon","Environmental Economics, Real Estate, Water Quality & Treatment, Environmental Science, Water Supply & Land Use, Conservation","The Worldwatch Environmental Alert"

For the Western leader assigned to the Chinese mainland, the career opportunities are unsurpassed. Expatriates have the privilege of playing a pivotal role in one of the most exciting economic and cultural transformations in recent world history. The time spent leading and managing in China will prove to be one of the most challenging, dynamic, and personally rewarding assignments an expatriate could hope to imagine. Leadership Success in China: An Expatriate s Guide is written for expatriate leaders who want to jump-start their China career and quickly get up and running in their new environment. The complexities of managing a team steeped in a culture vastly different from the expatriate s own cannot be underestimated. Some tried-and-true Western business practices can be applied; others will fall flat in the face of China s cultural differences. Still other, unique practices heretofore unknown to the expatriate leader might be a better fit. Leadership Success in China: An Expatriate s Guide details what techniques and practices will work for expatriates in China and how others, such as performance management and selection, will need to be augmented for the Chinese culture. It also notes the traps and pitfalls for the expatriate to avoid. This book is a practical, must-have handbook for leaders charged with building a productive, trusting, empowered team in China that can achieve the business and strategic goals set forth by the head office. Who Should Read It Leadership Success in China: An Expatriate s Guide is written for executives, managers, and human resource professionals who are on assignment or soon will be in mainland China and those who will interact frequently with Chinese as part of their managerial role. - from Amzon",,

For the majority of city dwellers, however, urbanization means living in the favelas of Brazil, the kampungs in Indonesia, katchi abadis in Pakistan, and in dense squatter areas of Metro Manila. For millions, life is devoid of basic human services. Inventoried and zoned according to access (or lack thereof) to basic services, quality of life in the Iskwater settlement is defined in terms of degrees of deprivation household size potable water, power supply, length of paved roads and sewage infrastructure.
<P>
This book, Lungsod Iskwater, began as an analytical exercise. Its principal focus was the most sustainable urban form in history -- the informal settlement. Despite its enduring presence over time and across cultures, the urban and architectural elements of Iskwater settlement are among the least studied, let alone the least understood. Thus, this effort attempts to provide an in-depth analysis of the relationship between built form and open space within selected informal settlements in Metropolitan Manila, and correlates specific cultural, socio-economic, political, and environmental factors. We build on the premise that informal settlements are organic combinations of interrelated and interdependent factors which may be decoded only when understood within certain cultural and historical contexts. - from Amzon",,

It traces the evolution of urban and metropolitan governance in India and examines the key aspects related to urban dynamics such as urban and regional planning, economic competitiveness, infrastructure and land management, environmental sustainability as well as the challenges in resource mobilization and metropolitan governance. The study is based on an extensive compilation of data on aspects such as demographics, economy, infrastructure, society, environment, political character, and institutions for governance. It provides an introduction to megacities in the Indian context and explains how urbanization was never promoted in the Indian Planning regime. While contributing greatly to the economic growth of the respective states and the country, the physical and demographic growth of these megacities has been accompanied by an ever increasing demand for infrastructure and essential services as well as social and environmental pressures. The governance and management of megacities has thus emerged as a formidable challenge to policymakers, administrators, and urban professionals. This book elucidates how urbanization was inevitable and was finally recognized as an economic and social reality by the Tenth five year plan.<br> - from Amzon","Urban & Regional, Infrastructure, State, Business & Finance, Government",

"Marketing Places","Philip Kotler",,,,"Free Press","First Edition Later Printing",1993,,0029175968,9780029175965,,B1,Unknown,,Book,"<P> Today's headlines report cities going bankrupt, states running large deficits, and nations stuck in high debt and stagnation. Philip Kotler, Donald Haider, and Irving Rein argue that thousands of ""places"" -- cities, states, and nations -- are in crisis, and can no longer rely on national industrial policies, such as federal matching funds, as a promise of jobs and protection. When trouble strikes, places resort to various palliatives such as chasing grants from state or federal sources, bidding for smokestack industries, or building convention centers and exotic attractions. The authors show instead that places must, like any market-driven business, become attractive ""products"" by improving their industrial base and communicating their special qualities more effectively to their target markets. <P> From studies of cities and nations throughout the world, Kotler, Haider, and Rein offer a systematic analysis of why so many places have fallen on hard times, and make recommendations on what can be done to revitalize a place's economy. They show how ""place wars"" -- battles for Japanese factories, government projects, Olympic Games, baseball team franchises, convention business, and other economic prizes -- are often misguided and end in wasted money and effort. The hidden key to vigorous economic development, the authors argue, is strategic marketing of places by rebuilding infrastructure, creating a skilled labor force, stimulating local business entrepreneurship and expansion, developing strong public/private partnerships, identifying and attracting ""place compatible"" companies and industries, creating distinctive local attractions, building a service-friendly culture, and promoting these advantages effectively. <P> Strategic marketing of places requires a deep understanding of how ""place buyers"" -- tourists, new residents, factories, corporate headquarters, investors -- make their place decisions. With this understanding, ""place sellers"" -- economic development agencies, tourist promotion agencies, mayor's offices -- can take the necessary steps to compete aggressively for place buyers. This straightforward guide for effectively marketing places will be the framework for economic development in the 1990s and beyond. - from Amzon","Development & Growth, Hospitality, Travel & Tourism, Global, Industrial, Research",

Through their association with SciArc (Southern California Institute for Architecture), of which Mayne was a founding member and where Rotondi is the present Director, they have also been a leading force for the younger generation of California architects.<br><br>The works of Morphosis have encompassed a wide range of building types, including the single-family house and multiple-unit housing, medical facilities and offices, restaurants and retail spaces. In all projects, a hallmark of their work is always a clean, crisp coolness expressing their almost uncanny ability to turn the most ordinary materials into surfaces and details of astonishing power and grace. The effect of this activity is intensified through structural ambiguity and shifting harmonies, in an architecture of economy and of extraordinary sophistication.<br><br>One of the unique features of the methods of design of Morphosis Architects is the way in which they use models and drawings. Unlike most architects, after a building is completed Mayne and Rotondi go back to the drawings and models, reworking and analyzing them as sources of inspiration and generation for new designs. It is through this activity of creating and re-creating that the name Morphosis is derived.<br></div> - from Amzon","Individual Architects & Firms, Drafting & Presentation, Architecture",

The location has revealed different facets to settlers and passers-through. The city, the site of bloody battles between the British and Tipu Sultan, was once attached to the glittering court of Mysore. Later, it became a cantonment town where British troops were stationed. Over time, it morphed into a city of gardens and lakes, and the capital of Indian scientific research. More recently, it has been the hub of India s information technology boom, giving rise to Brand Bangalore, an Indian city whose name is recognized globally. Hidden beneath these layers lies a cosmopolitan city of sub-cultures, engaging artists and writers, young geeks and students. People from every corner of India and beyond now call it home.  In this collection of writings about a multi-layered city, there are stories from its history, translations from Kannada literature, personal responses to the city s mindscape, portraits of special citizens, accounts of searches for lost communities and traditions, among much more. U.R. Ananthamurthy writes about Bangalore s Kannada identity; Shashi Deshpande maps the city through the places she has lived in since she was a young girl; Anita Nair draws a touching portrait of a florist who celebrates the glories of the Raj; Ramachandra Guha describes his close bond with Bangalore s most unusual bookseller; and Rajmohan Gandhi recounts the Mahatma s trysts with the city. From traditional folk ballads to a nursery rhyme about Bangalore, from poems to blogs, from reproductions of turn of the twentieth century picture postcards to cartoons, Multiple City is the portrait of a metropolis trying to retain its roots as it hurtles into the future. - from Amzon","World, Religion & Spirituality, Philosophy",

Within this context, design extensively avails itself of the technological bounty of advanced digital tools. Yet beyond these tools, the fluidity of digital information and the seemingly immaterial nature of communication dominate most discussions. </p><p>Understanding the contemporary networks of information and communication as inherently geographic, <i>Geographies of Information</i> attempts to realign design’s relationship to information and communication technologies (ICTs) by expounding on their multiscalar complexities and contextual intricacies. From the impact of digital social media on political action and the rise of predictive technologies in speculative real estate to new ways of mapping temporal conditions of a site and the evolving role of information in how designers see, understand, and act on space, ICTs exert critical influence. This issue of <i>New Geographies</i> examines the forms, imprints, places, and territories of ICTs through spatially grounded and nuanced accounts of the hybrid conditions that ICTs generate, the scales at which they operate, and how this production of space is manifested in both advanced and emerging economies.</p> - from Amzon","Urban & Land Use Planning, Decorative Arts & Design, Communication, Communication & Media Studies",

Five are new to this edition, including the 2008 update to his classic ""The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy,"" as well as new work on health care, philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, and CEO leadership. <br><BR>This collection captures Porter's unique ability to bridge theory and practice. Each of the articles has not only shaped thinking, but also redefined the work of practitioners in its respective field. In an insightful new introduction, Porter relates each article to the whole of his thinking about competition and value creation, and traces how that thinking has deepened over time.<br><BR>This collection is organized by topic, allowing the reader easy access to the wide range of Porter's work. Parts I and II present the frameworks for which Porter is best known--frameworks that address how companies, as well as nations and regions, gain and sustain competitive advantage. Part III shows how strategic thinking can address society's most pressing challenges, from environmental sustainability to improving health-care delivery. Part IV explores how both nonprofits and corporations can create value for society more effectively by applying strategy principles to philanthropy. Part V explores the link between strategy and leadership.<BR></div> - from Amzon","Environmental Economics, Theory, Economics, Education & Reference, Business",

Pierre Bourdieu, a distinguished French anthropologist, develops a theory of practice which is simultaneously a critique of the methods and postures of social science and a general account of how human action should be understood. With his central concept of the habitus, the principle which negotiates between objective structures and practices, Bourdieu is able to transcend the dichotomies which have shaped theoretical thinking about the social world. The author draws on his fieldwork in Kabylia (Algeria) to illustrate his theoretical propositions. With detailed study of matrimonial strategies and the role of rite and myth, he analyses the dialectical process of the 'incorporation of structures' and the objectification of habitus, whereby social formations tend to reproduce themselves. A rigorous consistent materialist approach lays the foundations for a theory of symbolic capital and, through analysis of the different modes of domination, a theory of symbolic power. - from Amzon","Social Sciences, Cultural, General, Sociology, Anthropology, Sociology",

The result is a view of a world that no longer seems real but appears instead as a series of dream-images from an eccentric director or computer game designer. References to reality evoke a sense of conflict in the viewer, as appreciation for the beauty of the absurd competes with recognition of an irreversible process of change in urban living space. Two different growth models are exposed: unscrupulous, uncontrolled expansion, as in Bangkok, and controlled, yet equally unscrupulous growth in a city like Shanghai. The pictures burst with conflicting signs and symbols, mostly indecipherable to the western viewer, a semiotic overkill held in check only by the edge of the picture frame. - from Amzon","Individual Artists, Color, Individual Photographers, Foreign Language Study & Reference",

The world faces many environmental trends of disruption and decline, including rising temperatures and spreading water shortage. In addition to these looming threats, we face the peaking of oil, annual population growth of 70 million, a widening global economic divide, and a growing list of failing states. The scale and complexity of issues facing our fast-forward world have no precedent<br /><br /> With Plan A, business as usual, we have neglected these issues overly long. In <em>Plan B 3.0</em>, Lester R.

In this brilliant and ambitious book, Mike Davis explores the future of a radically unequal and explosively unstable urban world. <br><br>From the sprawling <i>barricadas</i> of Lima to the garbage hills of Manila, urbanization has been disconnected from industrialization, even economic growth. Davis portrays a vast humanity warehoused in shantytowns and exiled from the formal world economy. He argues that the rise of this informal urban proletariat is a wholly original development unforeseen by either classical Marxism or neoliberal theory.<br><br>Are the great slums, as a terrified Victorian middle class once imagined, volcanoes waiting to erupt? Davis provides the first global overview of the diverse religious, ethnic, and political movements competing for the souls of the new urban poor. He surveys Hindu fundamentalism in Bombay, the Islamist resistance in Casablanca and Cairo, street gangs in Cape Town and San Salvador, Pentecostalism in Kinshasa and Rio de Janeiro, and revolutionary populism in Caracas and La Paz.<i>Planet of Slums</i> ends with a provocative meditation on the “war on terrorism” as an incipient world war between the American empire and the new slum poor. - from Amzon","Commercial Policy, Urban Planning & Development, Sociology, Commentary & Opinion, City Planning & Urban Development",

It demonstrates that the period 1970 to 1980 will be particularly crucial for Indonesia and will require careful social and economic planning. The author, who is acknowledged to be Indonesia's foremost economist demographer,amasses and corrects population estimates made during the era of Dutch rule, including material from as early as 1775. He discusses the census of 1930 and the impact of events of the 1940's - World War II, the Japanese occupation, and the Indonesian revolution - on population trends. He points out, for example, that low birth and high mortality rates during the subsequent period, suggest that the mean age of Indonesia's working age population is undergoing a radical rejuvenation.  Using the census of 1961 as a base, Mr. Widjojo projects Indonesia's population to 1991, forecasting the probable growth rates of the total population and of its various components. He shows how the population breaks down into extremely uneven age groups and suggests the serious consequences of this situation. He emphasizes that the dramatic increases in the number of 15-to-24-year-olds that occurred in the population during the second half of the 1960's and that are projected for the 1970's make careful preparation for the future imperative if crises in the labor market and in the field of education are to be dealt with successfully.  Population Trends in Indonesia, now brought back to life as a member of Equinox Publishing's Classic Indonesia series, serves as a model for future research and proves invaluable to economic and social planners working throughout the developing world.  Widjojo Nitisastro, former Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Indonesia, was Chairman of President Suharto's Economic Team and of the National Development Planning Agency. A graduate of the University of Indonesia, Professor Widjojo received a Ph.D. degree in Economics from the University of California at Berkeley. - from Amzon","Demography, Sociology, Sociology",

Market forces that prioritise profit generation are allowed to construct venues of consumption in its place. Though their physical appearance may resemble traditional public space, in reality, they are greatly restrictive and diminished in affordability, accessibility and social meaning. It is in this context that William SW Lim, chairman of Asian Urban Lab, has brought together architects, designers, historians, sociologists and urbanists from the region to discuss public space in selected Asian cities.</p><p>Part One contains essays from participants from Chongqing, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Taipei and observations from commentators. Several essays by William SW Lim on the subject round off the discussion in Part Two. The thoughtful essays in <i>Public Space in Urban Asia</i> emphasise how engaging with the present actuality of cities and public awareness of spatial justice in cities are crucial — for it is the achievement of spatial justice that will help create a greater level of happiness across societies in our increasingly urbanised world.</p><b>Contents:</b><ul><ul><li>Introduction and Acknowledgements</li><li>Foreword — Public Space in Asia: Ways of Knowing and Acting <i>(Leon Van Schaik)</i></li></ul><li><b><i>Part I: Public Space in Urban Asia:</i></b><ul><li>Public Space Today <i>(William S W Lim)</i></li><li>The Multiple Spaces of Bukit Brown <i>(Terence Chong and Chua Ai Lin)</i></li><li>Vestigial as Alternative: The KTM Rail Corridor and the Search for the Un-regularized <i>(Liew Kai Khiun)</i></li><li>The End of the Railroad in Singapore: A Photo Essay <i>(Claire Leow)</i></li><li>Singapore's Void Decks <i>(Stephen Cairns)</i></li><li>Hawker Centres: Siting/Sighting Singapore's Food Heritage <i>(Randy Chan and Jolene Lee)</i></li><li>Carnivalism in Public Spaces in Chongqing <i>(Wei Haoyan)</i></li><li>Taxonomy of Public Space in Contemporary Hong Kong <i>(Tat Lam and Benedetta Tavecchia)</i></li><li>Common Space and Public Space in Contemporary Urbanisation <i>(Marco Kusumawijaya)</i></li><li>Thick Crust of Time: Kuala Lumpur <i>(Lim Teng Ngiom)</i></li><li>Illegal Architecture: In the Name of Community <i>(Roan Ching-Yueh)</i></li></ul></li><li><b><i>Commentaries:</i></b><ul><li>Re-making Public Space Through and in Asia <i>(Jane M Jacobs)</i></li><li>Recalling the Political in Public Space <i>(H Koon Wee)</i></li><li>Sustaining Publics and Their Spaces: William Lim's Writings on Architecture and Space <i>(Lilian Chee)</i></li></ul></li><li><b><i>Part II: Change We Must and Other Essays:</i></b><ul><li>Global Dynamic Change and Power Rebalance <i>(William S W Lim)</i></li><li>Commentary on Incomplete Urbanism <i>(Andrew Lee, Leong Teng Wui and Ong Swee Hong)</i></li><li>Spatial Justice and Happiness <i>(William S W Lim)</i></li><li>Spatial Justice — A Singapore Case Study <i>(William S W Lim)</i></li><li>Change We Must <i>(William S W Lim)</i></li><li>Works Cited</li></ul></li></ul><br /><b>Readership:</b> Graduate and undergraduate students majoring in architecture, urban planning, sociology and geography; general readers interested in cities, heritage and development; city planners, developers, policy makers and economists.<br /> - from Amzon","Urban & Land Use Planning, Urban & Regional, Urban Planning & Development, Urban, Asian, City Planning & Urban Development, Specialty Boutique, Urban & Land Use Planning, Urban & Regional, Urban Planning & Development, Urban",

Significantly, these debates unfold in the context of his particular reading of the modern philosophical tradition from the German enlightment to the present period.<br /> In this original interpretation, David Rasmussen provides both guide and critique to the later Habermas encountered in the context of the best of the critical literature that has emerged in recent years. <i>Reading Habermas</i> argues that Habermas' concept of modernity provides the context for the theory of language as well as his approaches to law and ethics.<br /> This book, as its title implies, offers a reading. It explores philosophical options chosen in the light of other, rejected readings. It is a distinctive, readable contribution to the current controversy surrounding the most recent developments in critical theory. - from Amzon","Modern, Social Sciences, History & Surveys",

Realizing the Promise of Performance Management paints the picture of an invaluable system that can underpin and permeate all organizational efforts—driving straight through to an improved bottom line. This book describes a system that can enable an organization to seamlessly execute its business and cultural strategies in full alignment with its other important HR systems, such as selection, promotion, succession planning, and compensation.   Realizing the Promise of Performance Management presents more than a dozen case studies—depicting how some of the best-known global companies have leveraged their performance management systems to retain top talent, invigorate their workforces, reduce turnover, align capabilities, and grow their business. Drawing on lessons learned from more than 30 years’ experience with hundreds of companies, Robert W. Rogers presents a strong case for the whys of performance management—why spend time doing it right, why insist that senior executives model the process, why track how well the system works, and most of all, why demand that managers become skilled users of the system. Ultimately, as you’ll see by reading this book, because it will get results. - from Amzon",,

"Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning","Henry Mintzberg",,,,"Free Press",,1994,,0029216052,9780029216057,,E2,Unknown,,Book,"In this definitive and revealing history, Henry Mintzberg, the iconoclastic former president of the Strategic Management Society, unmasks the press that has mesmerized so many organizations since 1965: strategic planning. One of our most brilliant and original management thinkers, Mintzberg concludes that the term is an oxymoron -- that strategy cannot be planned because planning is about analysis and strategy is about synthesis. That is why, he asserts, the process has failed so often and so dramatically. <BR> Mintzberg traces the origins and history of strategic planning through its prominence and subsequent fall. He argues that we must reconceive the process by which strategies are created -- by emphasizing informal learning and personal vision -- and the roles that can be played by planners. Mintzberg proposes new and unusual definitions of planning and strategy, and examines in novel and insightful ways the various models of strategic planning and the evidence of why they failed. Reviewing the so-called ""pitfalls"" of planning, he shows how the process itself can destroy commitment, narrow a company's vision, discourage change, and breed an atmosphere of politics. In a harsh critique of many sacred cows, he describes three basic fallacies of the process -- that discontinuities can be predicted, that strategists can be detached from the operations of the organization, and that the process of strategy-making itself can be formalized. <BR> Mintzberg devotes a substantial section to the new role for planning, plans, and planners, not inside the strategy-making process, but in support of it, providing some of its inputs and sometimes programming its outputs as well as encouraging strategic thinking in general. This book is required reading for anyone in an organization who is influenced by the planning or the strategy-making processes. - from Amzon","Management, Management Science, Planning & Forecasting, Systems & Planning, Strategy & Competition, Entrepreneurship, Strategic Planning",

Then the rise of an executive class that pits one egotistical senior manager against another in senseless internal conflicts eventually leads to a long line of demented CEOs, excessive expansion, and foolish diversification—and a high cost in shattered lives.

Using salvaged lumber and bricks, discarded tires, hay and waste cardboard bales, concrete rubble, colored bottles, and old license plates, they create inexpensive buildings that bear the trademark of Mockbee's work, which he describes as ""contemporary modernism grounded in Southern culture.""In a time of unexampled prosperity, when architectural attention focuses on big, glossy urban projects, the Rural Studio provides an alternative of substance. In addition to being a social welfare venture, the Rural Studio--""Taliesin South"" as Mockbee calls it--is also an educational experiment and a prod to the architectural profession to act on its best instincts. In giving students hands-on experience in designing and building something real, it extends their education beyond paper architecture. And in scavenging and reusing a variety of unusual materials, it is a model of sustainable architecture. The work of Rural Studio has struck such a chord-both architecturally and socially--that it has been featured on Oprah, Nightline, and CBS News, as well as in Time and People magazines.The Studio has completed more than a dozen projects, including the Bryant ""Hay Bale"" House, Harris ""Butterfly"" House, Yancey Chapel, Akron Chapel, Children's Center, H.E.R.O. Playground, Lewis House, Super Sheds and Pods, Spencer House addition, Farmer's Market, Mason's Bend Community Center, Goat House, and Shannon-Dutley House. These buildings, along with the incredible story of the Rural Studio, the people who live there, and Mockbee and his student architects, are detailed in this colorful book, the first on the subject.""I tell my students, it's got to be warm, dry, and noble""--Samuel Mockbee - from Amzon","Individual Architects & Firms, History, Vernacular, State & Local, Methods & Materials, Study & Teaching, Teen & Young Adult, Architecture",

In words that could just as easily have been written today as fifty years ago, they detail techniques and strategies for attaining success as individual investors, as well as the responsibilities of corporate decision makers to build shareholder value and transparency for those investors.</p> <p>The focus of the book, however, remains its timeless guidance and advice--that careful analysis of balance sheets is the primary road to investment success, with all other considerations little more than distractions. The authors had seen and survived the Great Depression as well as the political and financial instabilities of World War II and were now better able to outline a program for sensible and profitable investing in the latter half of the century.</p> <p><i>Security Analysis: The Classic 1951 Edition</i> marks the return of this long-out-of-print work to the investment canon. It will reacquaint you with the foundations of value investing--more relevant than ever in tumultuous twenty-first century markets--and allow you to own the third installment in what has come to be regarded as the most accessible and usable title in the history of investment publishing.</p> - from Amzon","Economics, Stocks",

Yet traditional forms of sharing have been undermined in modern cities by social fragmentation and commercialization of the public realm. In <i> Sharing Cities</i>, Duncan McLaren and Julian Agyeman argue that the intersection of cities' highly networked physical space with new digital technologies and new mediated forms of sharing offers cities the opportunity to connect smart technology to justice, solidarity, and sustainability. McLaren and Agyeman explore the opportunities and risks for sustainability, solidarity, and justice in the changing nature of sharing. </p><p>McLaren and Agyeman propose a new ""sharing paradigm,"" which goes beyond the faddish ""sharing economy"" -- seen in such ventures as Uber and TaskRabbit -- to envision models of sharing that are not always commercial but also communal, encouraging trust and collaboration. Detailed case studies of San Francisco, Seoul, Copenhagen, Medellín, Amsterdam, and Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) contextualize the authors' discussions of collaborative consumption and production; the shared public realm, both physical and virtual; the design of sharing to enhance equity and justice; and the prospects for scaling up the sharing paradigm though city governance. They show how sharing could shift values and norms, enable civic engagement and political activism, and rebuild a shared urban commons. Their case for sharing and solidarity offers a powerful alternative for urban futures to conventional ""race-to-the-bottom"" narratives of competition, enclosure, and division. </p> - from Amzon","Environmental Economics, Sustainable Development, Environmental, Environmental Science, Urban Planning & Development, Urban, City Planning & Urban Development",

Whether with a laptop or smartphone, we search the web from wherever we are, at any given moment. 'Googling' has become so entwined in our daily routines that we rarely question it. However, search engines such as Google or Bing determine what part of the web we get to see, shaping our knowledge and perceptions of the world. But there is a world beyond Google - geographically, culturally, and technologically.   The Society of the Query network was founded in 2009 to delve into the larger societal and cultural consequences that are triggered by search technology. In this Reader, which is published after two conferences held in Amsterdam in 2009 and 2013, twenty authors - new media scholars, historians, computer scientists, and artists - try to answer a number of pressing questions about online search. - from Amzon",,

In the mid-1990s, Daniel Goleman popularized research into emotional intelligence, EQ, pointing out that EQ is a basic requirement for the appropriate use of IQ. There is enough collective evidence from psychology, neurology, anthropology and cognitiv science to hsow us that there is a third ""Q"", ""SQ"" or Spiritual Intelligence. Unlike IQ, which computers have and EQ which exists in higher mammals, SQ is uniquely human and, the author argues, the most fundamental of the three. It is linked to humanity's need for meaning, an issue very much at the forefront of people's minds as the century draws to a close. SQ is what we use to develop our longing and capacity for meaning, vision and value. It allows us to dream and to strive. - from Amzon","Personal Transformation, Religion & Spirituality, Humanism",

But such measures are mere Band-Aids, and they may actually do more harm than good, says John Ehrenfeld, a pioneer in the field of industrial ecology.

Ehrenfeld identifies problematic cultural attributessuch as the unending consumption that characterizes modern lifeand outlines practical steps toward developing sustainability as a mindset.

Created out of a technological revolution, the formation of the global economy and the emergence of a new form of economic production and management, they constitute the mines and foundries of the information age, redefining the conditions and processes of local and regional development. This book is the first systematic survey of technopoles in all manifestations: science parks, science cities, national technopoles and technobelt programmes. Detailed case studies, ranging from the Silicon Valley to Siberia and from the M4 Corridor to Taiwan, relate how global technopoles have developed, what each is striving to achieve and how well it is succeeding. <EM>Technopoles of the World</EM> distills the lessons learnt from the successes and failures, embracing a host of disparate concepts and a few myths, and offering guidelines for national, regional and local planners and developers worldwide. - from Amzon","Environmental Economics, Engineering, Regional, Technology, Politics & Government, Earth Sciences, Political Science",

Blue eyes. Lactose tolerance. What do all of these traits have in common? Every one of them has emerged in the last 10,000 years.</B><BR><BR>Scientists have long believed that the great leap forward” that occurred some 40,000 to 50,000 years ago in Europe marked end of significant biological evolution in humans. In this stunningly original account of our evolutionary history, top scholars Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending reject this conventional wisdom and reveal that the human species has undergone a storm of genetic change much more recently. Human evolution in fact accelerated after civilization arose, they contend, and these ongoing changes have played a pivotal role in human history. They argue that biology explains the expansion of the Indo-Europeans, the European conquest of the Americas, and European Jews' rise to intellectual prominence. In each of these cases, the key was recent genetic change: adult milk tolerance in the early Indo-Europeans that allowed for a new way of life, increased disease resistance among the Europeans settling America, and new versions of neurological genes among European Jews.<BR><BR>Ranging across subjects as diverse as human domestication, Neanderthal hybridization, and IQ tests, Cochran and Harpending's analysis demonstrates convincingly that human genetics have changed and can continue to change much more rapidly than scientists have previously believed. A provocative and fascinating new look at human evolution that turns conventional wisdom on its head, <I>The 10,000 Year Explosion</I> reveals the ongoing interplay between culture and biology in the making of the human race.</div> - from Amzon","Civilization & Culture, Biological Sciences, Genetics",

Drawing upon these orders and records, along with the previously unheard stories of 70 survivors, perpetrators, and other eyewitness of the genocide in Aceh province it reconstructs, for the first time, a detailed narrative of the killings using the military’s own accounts of these events. This book makes the case that the 1965-66 killings can be understood as a case of genocide, as defined by the 1948 Genocide Convention. </P> <P>The first book to reconstruct a detailed narrative of the genocide using the army’s own records of these events, it will be of interest to students and academics in the field of Southeast Asian Studies, History, Politics, the Cold War, Political Violence and Comparative Genocide.</P> - from Amzon","Ethnic Studies, Social Sciences, politics, military, Indonesia",

They generally don't kill a huge number of people. Most years more people kill themselves than are killed by Nature's tantrums. And using standard measures like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) it is difficult to show that disasters significantly interrupt the economy.</p><p>It's what happens after the disasters that really matters-when the media has lost interest and the last volunteer has handed out a final blanket, and people are left to repair their lives. What happens is a stark expression of how unjustly unequal our world has become. The elite make out well-whether they belong to an open market capitalist democracy or a closed authoritarian socialist state. In Myanmar-a country ruled by a xenophobic military junta-the generals and their cronies declared areas where rice farms were destroyed by Cyclone Nargis as blighted and simply took the land. In New Orleans the city was re-shaped and gentrified post Katrina, making it almost impossible for many of its poorest, mostly black citizens to return.</p><p>In <i>The Disaster Profiteers</i>, John Mutter argues that when no one is looking, disasters become a means by which the elite prosper at the expense of the poor. As the specter of increasingly frequent and destructive natural disasters looms in our future, this book will ignite an essential conversation about what we can do now to create a safer, more just world for us all.</p> - from Amzon","Urban & Land Use Planning, Environmental Science, Disaster Relief, Poverty, Urban, Class",

"The Future","Al Gore",,,,"W H Allen",,2013,,0753540495,9780753540497,,G2,Ecology,,Book,"<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER</b><br><br>From the former vice president and #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author comes <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> for everything—a frank and clear-eyed assessment of six critical drivers of global change in the decades to come.<br>  <br> Ours is a time of revolutionary change that has no precedent in history. With the same passion he brought to the challenge of climate change, and with his decades of experience on the front lines of global policy, Al Gore surveys our planet’s beclouded horizon and offers a sober, learned, and ultimately hopeful forecast in the visionary tradition of Alvin Toffler’s <i>Future Shock</i> and John Naisbitt’s <i>Megatrends</i>. In <i>The Future,</i> Gore identifies the emerging forces that are reshaping our world:<br>  <br> • Ever-increasing economic globalization has led to the emergence of what he labels “Earth Inc.”—an integrated holistic entity with a new and different relationship to capital, labor, consumer markets, and national governments than in the past.<br> • The worldwide digital communications, Internet, and computer revolutions have led to the emergence of “the Global Mind,” which links the thoughts and feelings of billions of people and connects intelligent machines, robots, ubiquitous sensors, and databases.<br> • The balance of global political, economic, and military power is shifting more profoundly than at any time in the last five hundred years—from a U.S.-centered system to one with multiple emerging centers of power, from nation-states to private actors, and from political systems to markets.<br> • A deeply flawed economic compass is leading us to unsustainable growth in consumption, pollution flows, and depletion of the planet’s strategic resources of topsoil, freshwater, and living species.<br> • Genomic, biotechnology, neuroscience, and life sciences revolutions are radically transforming the fields of medicine, agriculture, and molecular science—and are putting control of evolution in human hands.<br> • There has been a radical disruption of the relationship between human beings and the earth’s ecosystems, along with the beginning of a revolutionary transformation of energy systems, agriculture, transportation, and construction worldwide.<br>  <br> From his earliest days in public life, Al Gore has been warning us of the promise and peril of emergent truths—no matter how “inconvenient” they may seem to be. As absorbing as it is visionary, <i>The Future</i> is a map of the world to come, from a man who has looked ahead before and been proven all too right.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Future</i></b><br> <b> </b><br>“Magisterial . . . The passion is unmistakable. So is the knowledge. Practically every page offers an illumination.”—Bloomberg<br>  <br> “In <i>The Future</i> . . . Gore takes on a subject whose scale matches that of his achievements and ambition.”—<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br> <i> </i><br> “Historically grounded . . . Gore’s strengths lie in his passion for the subject and in his ability to take the long view by putting current events and trends in historical context.”—<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>  <br> “Provocative, smart, densely argued . . . a tour de force of Big Picture thinking.”—<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br>  <br> “A luminously intelligent analysis that is packed with arresting ideas and facts.”—<i>The Guardian</i> - from Amzon",,

He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence. <em>The God Delusion</em> makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.</div> - from Amzon","Philosophy, Atheism, History & Philosophy",

Cities remain specifically historical creations. They have not always existed; they began at a certain time in the evolution of society and can be ended or radically transformed at another.

A chilling report on Cambodia warns of the political re-emergence of the murderous Khmer Rouge. A portrait of Burma limns how that republic's form of Buddhism tolerates tyranny and describes the nascent protest movement led by Aung San Suu Kyi.

From a western perspective the rise of the emergent business and professional class may seem very familiar. However, it is far from clear that those newly enriched by the processes of modernization in East and South East Asia are readily comparable with the middle classes of the West. For example, civil and human rights seem to play a different role in social, political and economic change, and the State is clearly more central as an agent of economic development. This volume is the essential introduction to the series, and identifies the 'new rich' phenomenon in Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The contributors demonstrate that the key to understanding the 'new rich' is to realise that they are neither a single category or class, but in each setting a series of different socio-political groups who have a common inheritance from the process of rapid economic growth. - from Amzon","Ethnic Studies, Sociology, Asian, Middle Eastern, Political Science, Sociology",

Ten years ago, Michael Pollan confronted us with this seemingly simple question and, with <i>The Omnivore’s Dilemma, </i>his brilliant and eye-opening exploration of our food choices, demonstrated that how we answer it today may determine not only our health but our survival as a species. In the years since, Pollan’s revolutionary examination has changed the way Americans think about food. Bringing wide attention to the little-known but vitally important dimensions of food and agriculture in America, Pollan launched a national conversation about what we eat and the profound consequences that even the simplest everyday food choices have on both ourselves and the natural world. Ten years later, <i>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</i> continues to transform the way Americans think about the politics, perils, and pleasures of eating. - from Amzon","History, Paleo, Vegan, Nutrition, Reference, Popular Culture",

This book is intended as a starting point for anyone involved in the building industry on a journey to learn how they can build more responsibly. The book is rooted in practical knowledge but rather than being a ‘how to book’ asks individuals to understand how the philosophy of sustainable design can affect their own work. Part Sustainable Design 101 and part manifesto this book lays the groundwork and philosophical basis for more technical study. McLennan relies on his extensive experience with sustainable design having consulted to dozens of projects and design teams all over the country. Tapping into the work of many pioneers and ‘green design philosophers’ McLennan clearly presents a framework for people to understand Sustainable Design and how ultimately it will become the future of architecture and design. - from Amzon","Sustainability & Green Design, Economics, Environmentalism",

Habraken",,,,"The MIT Press",Revised,2000,,0262581957,9780262581950,,I3,Unknown,,Book,"<p><b>The influential Dutch architect's long-awaited manifesto on the everyday environment as the first and best ground for establishing the significance and coherence of architecture.</b></p><p>According to N. J. Habraken, intimate and unceasing interaction between people and the forms they inhabit uniquely defines built environment. <i>The Structure of the Ordinary</i>, the culmination of decades of environmental observation and design research, is a recognition and analysis of everyday environment as the wellspring of urban design and formal architecture. The author's central argument is that built environment is universally organized by the Orders of Form, Place, and Understanding. These three fundamental, interwoven principles correspond roughly to physical, biological, and social domains.</p><p>Historically, ""ordinary"" environment was the background against which architects built the ""extraordinary."" Drawing upon extensive examples from archaeological and contemporary sites worldwide, the author illustrates profound recent shifts in the structure of everyday environment. One effect of these transformations, Habraken argues, has been the loss of implicit common understanding that previously enabled architects to formally enhance and innovate while still maintaining environmental coherence. Consequently, architects must now undertake a study of the ordinary as the fertile common ground in which form- and place-making are rooted. In focusing on built environment as an autonomous entity distinct from the societies and natural environments that jointly create it, this book lays the foundation for a new dialogue on methodology and pedagogy, in support of a more informed approach to professional intervention.</p> - from Amzon","Criticism, Drafting & Presentation, Architecture",

"The Third Way and its Critics","Anthony Giddens",,,,Polity,1,2000,,0745624502,9780745624501,,G1,Unknown,,Book,"The idea of finding a 'third way' in politics has become a focus of discussion across the world. Political leaders, in the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America claim to be following its principles. Yet the notion has also attracted much criticism. Some say it is an empty concept without any real content. Critics from the more traditional left argue that it is a betrayal of left-wing ideals. <br /> <br /> <br /> Anthony Giddens's The Third Way (Polity Press, 1998) is regarded by many as the key text of third way politics. Translated into twenty-five languages, it has shaped the development of the third way. In this new book Giddens responds to the critics, and further develops the ideas set out in his earlier volume. Far from being unable to deal with inequalities of wealth and power, he shows, third way politics offers the only feasible approach to these issues. The work is indispensable for anyone who wants to understand the most important political debate going on today. <br /> <br /> <br /> Anthony Giddens is the Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science. He is the author or editor of over thirty books. His previous works, especially Beyond Left and Right (Polity Press, 1994) have influenced debates about the future of social democracy in many countries across the world. Frequently referred to in the UK as Tony Blair's guru, Giddens has made a strong impact on the evolution of New Labour. - from Amzon","Democracy, Communism & Socialism, International & World Politics, History & Theory",

"The World is Flat","Thomas Friedman",,,,Picador,"2Rev Ed",2007,,0141034890,9780141034898,,C1,Unknown,,Book,"The beginning of the twenty-first century will be remembered, Friedman argues, not for military conflicts or political events, but for a whole new age of globalization - a `flattening' of the world. The explosion of advanced technologies now means that suddenly knowledge pools and resources have connected all over the planet, levelling the playing field as never before, so that each of us is potentially an equal - and competitor - of the other. The rules of the game have changed forever - but does this `death of distance', which requires us all to run faster in order to stay in the same place, mean the world has got too small and too flat too fast for us to adjust? Friedman brilliantly demystifies the exciting, often bewildering, global scene unfolding before our eyes, one which we sense but barely yet understand. The World is Flat is the most timely and essential update on globalization, its successes and its discontents, powerfully illuminated by a world-class writer. In his new chapters: 'If It's Not Happening, It's Because You're Not Doing It' and 'What Happens When We All Have Dog's Hearing?' the author explores both the benefits and disadvantages of the very latest developments in global communication. The emergent popularity of blogging, pod-casting, YouTube and MySpace enable the modern world citizen to broadcast their views to a potential audience of billions, and the proliferation of Internet access to even the poorest communities gives everyone who wants to the tools to address issues of social injustice and inequality. On the other hand the technology that seems to improve communication on a global scale causes it to deteriorate on a local scale. Identifying ours as 'The Age of Interruption', Friedman discusses the annoyance and dangers of BlackBerrys in meeting rooms, hands-free kits in conversation and using a phone or iPod whilst driving. In an age when we are always 'connected' via email or mobile phone how can we hope to concentrate on one thing without interruption? As expected the author has revitalised this new edition of The World Is Flat with timely insights into the nature of our flat world. - from Amzon","Economic History, History, Engineering, Social Aspects, Globalization",

"Tri Hita Karana: The Spirit of Bali","Jan Hendrik Peters; Wisnu Wardana",,,,"Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia",,2013,,9799106370,9789799106377,,C2,Unknown,,Book,"Synopsis: This book neither wants to make an accusation, nor impose things that are impossible to carry out. It merely wants to make the Balinese and tourists aware of what is happening in this paradise on earth and about the positive infl uence they can have in preserving the culture of the beautiful island of Bali.  Tri Hita Karana, the spirit of Bali originated from the rich Balinese-Hindu philosophy. Tri Hita Karana means three causes of happiness: balanced and harmonious relationships of humans with God; of humans with fellow human beings; and of humans with the surrounding nature. Respect and togetherness are essential values in this philosophy. The Hindu doctrine of tat tvam asi, “I am you and you are me”, teaches us that all things are connected. Humans who do not respect God, fellow humans and nature are not respecting themselves, and this will eventually lead to self-destruction. Respect and togetherness will leadto harmony and happiness.  Since the Balinese are already living according to the age-old philosophy of Tri Hita Karana, they can contribute to a sustainable environment for their children. The past and the present cannot be separated from each other; the present is born out of the past. Our actions to create a sustainable environment today matter, or in Gandhi’s words: the future depends on what we do today.  The authors, Jan Hendrik Peters, a former professor of service studies and Wisnu Wardana, chief-editor of Bali Travel Newspaper, are deeply concerned about the negative infl uences of mass tourism and want to plead for a sustainable future for Bali, by writing this book.  “We really do need this book on Bali to make the Balinese people and the international tourists familiar with the essence of Hinduism. If the Balinese follow the philosophy of Tri Hita Karana as a guide in their personal life and business, it means that Bali will be the Island of the Gods forever.” - Ida Pedanda Subali Tianyar, Hindu high priest, Chairman of the Council of Hindu Priests in Indonesia.

The new edition continues to cover urban economics as the discipline that lies at the intersection of geography and economics. ""Urban Economics"" incorporates the remarkable progress in the field of urban economics from the last fifteen years. It also explores the location decisions of utility-maximizing households and profit-maximizing firms, and it shows how these decisions cause the formation of cities of different size and shape. The framework of this edition continues to be divided into six sections. Part I explains why cities exist and what causes hem to grow or shrink. Part II examines the market forces that shape cities and the role of government in determining land-use patterns. Part III looks at the urban transportation system. Part IV uses a model of the rational criminal to explore the causes of urban crime and its spatial consequences. Part V explains the unique features of the housing market and examines the effects of government housing policies. Part VI explains the rationale for our fragmented system of local government and explores the responses of local governments to intergovernmental grants and the responses of taxpayers to local taxes. - from Amzon","Urban & Regional, Economics",

Rachel Botsman, Roo Rogers","Rachel Botsman",,,,Collins,,2011,,0007395914,9780007395910,,H1,consumerism,,Book,"In the 20th century humanity consumed products faster than ever, but this way of living is no longer sustainable. This new and important book shows how technological advances are driving forms of `collaborative consumption' which will change forever the ways in which we interact both with businesses and with each other.The average lawn mower is used for four hours a year. The average power drill is used for only twenty minutes in its entire lifespan. The average car is unused for 22 hours a day, and even when it is being used there are normally three empty seats. Surely there must be a way to get the benefit out of things like mowers, drills and even cars, without having to carry the huge up-front costs of ownership?There is indeed. Collaborative consumption is not just a buzzword, it is a new win-win way of life. This insightful and thought-provoking new book by Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers is an important and fast-moving survey of the dramatic changes we are seeing in the way we consume products.Many of us are familiar with freecycle, eBay, couchsurfing and Zipcar. But these are just the beginning of a new phenomenon. Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers have interviewed business leaders and opinion formers around the world to draw together the many strands of Collaborative Consumption into a coherent and challenging argument to show that the way we did business and consumerism in the 20th century is not the way we will do it in the 21st century. - from Amzon","Macroeconomics, Consumer Behavior, Social Sciences",

Unpredictable, cantankerous, a striking figure with white hair, cape and cane, Frank Lloyd Wright was an individualistic spirit who delighted in acting out his own myth. Here is an intimate view of the many moods of Wright the man, warts and all, the inspired teacher, and the creative visionary, by a devoted student who came to know him as few others have.<BR>Now a successful architect in his own right, Tafel takes us back to 1932 and the early years of the Taliesin Fellowship when a group of promising young apprentices gathered in Spring Green, Wisconsin, to  be near the 65-year-old master and work at his elbow. We are privy to the incredible richness and diversity of Wright's thinking, his passion for artistic truth and devotion to the cause of architecture, his unfailing creative surges, as well as to his eccentricities and fascinating details about life at Taliesin. We see genius at close range as he designs the most famous house of the twentieth century. Fallingwater, the magnificent Johnson Wax Building and Wingspread; as he ceaselessly tinkers with his designs, all the while proclaiming his organic theories of architecture; as he badgers, bullies, awes and inspires a generation of young architects.<BR>Tafel's memoir provides us with a rare view of the man who considered his chief mission in life to create a genuinely American architecture and style of living, wholly personal and original. Here are illuminating anecdotes about his Prairie house and Oak Park periods, his disdain for the Bauhaus school and its leading practitioners, his total immersion in the design and construction of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, his romance with concrete, his efforts to develop the practical ""Usonian homes,"" and much else. It is also an enlightening summary of the facts and forces which influenced the history of American architecture.<BR>Written with affection and admiration, and enhanced with over 300 photographs — many never before published — <I>Years with Frank Lloyd Wright</I> offers an unusually candid portrait of the brilliant, eccentric genius who charted a new course for modern architecture.</div> - from Amzon","Individual Architects & Firms, Architecture",
